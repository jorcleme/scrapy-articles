Level 15\u2014Users with this level can run all commands. Only users at this level can access the web GUI. A system administrator (user with level 15) can create passwords that allow a lower-level user to temporarily become a higher-level user. For example, the user may go from level 1 to level 7, level 1 to 15, or level 7 to level 15. The passwords for each level are set (by an administrator) using the following command: enable password [level privilege-level]{password|encrypted encrypted-password} Using these passwords, you can raise your user level by entering the command: enable and the password for level 7 or 15. You can go from level 1 to level 7 or directly to level 15. The higher level holds only for the current session. The disable command returns the user to a lower level. To create a user and assign it a user level, use the username command. Only users with command level 15 can create users at this level.

    "page_content": "The CLI is divided into four command modes. The command modes are (in the order in which they are accessed): User EXEC mode Privileged EXEC mode Global Configuration mode Each command mode has its own unique console prompt and set of CLI commands. Entering a question mark at the console prompt displays a list of available commands for the current mode and for the level of the user. Specific commands are used to switch from one mode to another. Users are assigned privilege levels that determine the modes and commands available to them. User EXEC Mode Users with level 1 initially log into User EXEC mode. User EXEC mode is used for tasks that do not change the configuration, such as performing basic tests and listing system information. The user-level prompt consists of the switch host name followed by a  . The default host name is switchxxxxxx where xxxxxx is the last six digits of the device\u2019s MAC address, as shown below switchxxxxxx  The default host name can be changed via the hostname command in Global Configuration mode. Privileged EXEC Mode A user with level 7 or 15 automatically logs into Privileged EXEC mode. Users with level 1 can enter Privileged Exec mode by entering the enable command, and when prompted, the password for level 15. To return from the Privileged EXEC mode to the User EXEC mode, use the disable command Global Configuration Mode The Global Configuration mode is used to run commands that configure features at the system level, as opposed to the interface level. Only users with command level of 7 or 15 can access this mode. To access Global Configuration mode from Privileged EXEC mode, enter the configure command at the Privileged EXEC mode prompt and press Enter. The Global Configuration mode prompt, consisting of the device host name followed by (config) , is displayed: switchxxxxxx(config)  Use any of the following commands to return from Global Configuration mode to the Privileged EXEC mode: exit end Ctrl+Z The following example shows how to access Global Configuration mode and return to Privileged EXEC mode: switchxxxxxx  switchxxxxxx  configure switchxxxxxx(config)  exit switchxxxxxx  Interface or Line Configuration Modes Various submodes may be entered from Global Configuration mode. These submodes enable performing commands on a group of interfaces or lines. For instance to perform several operations on a specific port or range of ports, you can enter the Interface Configuration mode for that interface. The following example enters Interface Configuration mode for vlan1 and then sets their speed: The exit command returns to Global Configuration mode. switchxxxxxx  switchxxxxxx  configure switchxxxxxx(config)  interface range vlan1 switchxxxxxx(config-if) speed 10 switchxxxxxx(config-if) exit switchxxxxxx(config)  The following is a sample of some of the available submodes: Interface\u2014Contains commands that configure a specific interface (port, VLAN, port channel, or tunnel) or range of interfaces. The Global Configuration mode command interface is used to enter the Interface Configuration mode. The interface Global Configuration command is used to enter this mode. Line Interface\u2014Contains commands used to configure the management connections for the console, Telnet and SSH. These include commands such as line timeout settings, etc. The line Global Configuration command is used to enter the Line Configuration command mode. VLAN Database\u2014Contains commands used to configure a VLAN as a whole. The vlan database Global Configuration mode command is used to enter the VLAN Database Interface Configuration mode. Management Access List\u2014Contains commands used to define management access-lists. The management access-list Global Configuration mode command is used to enter the Management Access List Configuration mode. MAC Access-List, IPv6 Access List, IP Access List\u2014Configures conditions required to allow traffic based on MAC addresses, IPv6 address and IPv4 address, respectively. The mac access-list, ipv6 access-list and ip access-list Global Configuration mode commands are used to enter the these configuration mode. To return from any Interface Configuration mode to the Global Configuration mode, use the exit command.",

The hash value is sent by the device administrator and the Cisco support person for signing on a secure Cisco server using a private key. The output of this operation is used as the password for debug interface access. The password is good for current session.

There is an IP path such that the computer and the switch can reach each other Using a Terminal over the Console Interface The device supports a dual console management interface - a Type-C USB interface and an RJ45 port. If both Type-C USB and RJ45 are connected the Type-C USB interface has precedence. To support the Type-C interface a driver may need to be installed on the management station. Note The Type-C USB interface will become active a few seconds after the device is turned on/rebooted. After the computer and switch are connected, run a terminal application to access the CLI. The terminal emulator must be configured to databits=8 and parity=none. Click Enter twice, so that the device sets the serial port speed to match the PC's serial port speed. When the CLI appears, enter cisco at the User Name prompt and then enter cisco for the Password prompt. Note If this is the first time that you have logged on with the default username and password, the device will display a prompt to change username and Password.

One option must be selected. For example, flowcontrol {auto|on|off} means that for the flowcontrol command, either auto, on, or off must be selected \" (inverted commas) When the input string contains space and/or reserved words (i.e. VLAN), put the string in inverted commas. parameter Italic text indicates a parameter. press key Names of keys to be pressed are shown in bold. Ctrl+F4 Keys separated by the + character are to be pressed simultaneously on the keyboard Screen Display Fixed-width font indicates CLI prompts, CLI commands entered by the user, and system messages displayed on the console. all When a parameter is required to define a range of ports or parameters and all is an option, the default for the command is all when no parameters are defined. For example, the command interface range port-channel has the option of either entering a range of channels, or selecting all. When the command is entered without a parameter, it automatically defaults to all. text When free text can be entered as a parameter for a command (for example in command: snmp-server contact) if the text consists of multiple words separated by blanks, the entire string must appear in double quotes.

    "page_content": "Entering Commands A CLI command is a series of keywords and arguments. Keywords identify a command, and arguments specify configuration parameters. For example, in the command show interfaces status Gigabitethernet 1, show, interfaces and status are keywords, Gigabitethernet is an argument that specifies the interface type, and1 specifies the port. To enter commands that require parameters, enter the required parameters after the command keyword. For example, to set a password for the administrator, enter: switchxxxxxx(config)  username admin password Alansmith1 When working with the CLI, the command options are not displayed. The standard command to request help is ? There are two instances where help information can be displayed: Keyword lookup\u2014The character ? is entered in place of a command. A list of all valid commands and corresponding help messages are is displayed Partial keyword lookup\u2014If a command is incomplete and or the character ? is entered in place of a parameter, the matched keyword or parameters for this command are displayed. Terminal Command Buffer Every time a command is entered in the CLI, it is recorded on an internally managed Command History buffer. Commands stored in the buffer are maintained on a First In First Out (FIFO) basis. These commands can be recalled, reviewed, modified, and reissued. This buffer is not preserved across device resets. Keyword Description Up-Arrow key Recalls commands in the history buffer, beginning with the most recent command. Repeat the key sequence to recall successively older commands. Down-Arrow key Returns to more recent commands in the history buffer after recalling commands with the up-arrow key. Repeating the key sequence will recall successively more recent commands. By default, the history buffer system is enabled, but it can be disabled at any time. For more information on enabling or disabling the history buffer, refer to the history command. There is a standard default number of commands that are stored in the buffer. The standard number of 10 commands can be increased to 216. By configuring 0, the effect is the same as disabling the history buffer system. For more information on configuring the command history buffer, refer to the history size command. To display the history buffer, refer to the show history command. Negating the Effect of Commands For many configuration commands, the prefix keyword no can be entered to cancel the effect of a command or reset the configuration to the default value. This Reference Guide provides a description of the negation effect for each CLI command. Command Completion If the command entered is incomplete, invalid or has missing or invalid parameters, then the appropriate error message is displayed. This assists in entering the correct command. By pressing Tab after an incomplete command is entered, the system will attempt to identify and complete the command. If the characters already entered are not enough for the system to identify a single matching command, press ? to display the available commands matching the characters already entered. Keyboard Shortcuts The CLI has a range of keyboard shortcuts to assist in editing the CLI commands. The following table describes the CLI shortcuts. Keyboard Key Description Up-arrow Recalls commands from the history buffer, beginning with the most recent command. Repeat the key sequence to recall successively older commands. Down-arrow Returns the most recent commands from the history buffer after recalling commands with the up arrow key. Repeating the key sequence will recall successively more recent commands. Ctrl+A Moves the cursor to the beginning of the command line. Ctrl+E Moves the cursor to the end of the command line. Ctrl+Z / End Returns back to the Privileged EXEC mode from any configuration mode. Backspace Deletes one character left to the cursor position. Copying and Pasting Text Up to 1000 lines of text (or commands) can be copied and pasted into the device. Note It is the user\u2019s responsibility to ensure that the text copied into the device consists of legal commands only. When copying and pasting commands from a configuration file, make sure that the following conditions exist: A device Configuration mode has been accessed. The commands contain no encrypted data, like encrypted passwords or keys. Encrypted data cannot be copied and pasted into the device except for encrypted passwords where the keyword encrypted is used before the encrypted data (for instance in the enable password command).",

    "page_content": "When an IP application on a router wants to communicate with a remote IP application, it must select the local IP address to be used as its IP address. It can use any IP address defined on the router, but if this link goes down, the communication is aborted, even though there might well be another IP route between these IP applications. The loopback interface is a virtual interface whose operational state is always up. If the IP address that is configured on this virtual interface is used as the local address when communicating with remote IP applications, the communication will not be aborted even if the actual route to the remote application was changed. The name of the loopback interface is loopback1. A loopback interface does not support bridging; it cannot be a member of any VLAN, and no layer 2 protocol can be enabled on it. Layer 3 Specification IP Interface IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be assigned to a loopback interface. The IPv6 link-local interface identifier is 1. Routing Protocols A routing protocol running on the switch supports the advertising of the IP prefixes defined on the loopback interfaces via the routing protocol redistribution mechanism. Configuration Examples Static RoutingThe following example shows you how to configure IP on a switch with static routing:Switch  configure terminal Switch(config)  interface vlan 1 Switch(config-if)  ip address 10.10.10.2 /24 Switch(config-if)  ipv6 address 2001:DB8:2222:7270:2312/64 Switch(config-if)  exit Switch(config)  interface vlan 2 Switch(config-if)  ip address 10.11.11.2 /24 Switch(config-if)  ipv6 address 2001:DB8:3333:7271:2312/64 Switch(config-if)  exit Switch(config)  interface loopback 1 Switch(config-if)  ip address 172.25.13.2 /32 Switch(config-if)  ipv6 address 2001:DB8:2222:7272:72/128 Switch(config-if)  exit Switch(config)  ip route 0.0.0.0/0 10.10.11.1 Switch(config)  ip route 10.11.0.0 /16 10.11.11.1 Switch(config)  ipv6 route 0:/0 2001:DB8:2222:7270:1 Switch(config)  ipv6 route 2001:DB8:3333:/48 2001:DB8:3333:7271:1The neighbor router 10.10.11.1 should be configured with the following static route: ip route 172.25.13.2 /32 10.10.10.2.

Fiber cable and Transceivers Cisco brand provides a panoply a SFP modules, while our switches support other 3rd party, it is important to pay attention on the type of fiber cable to use in conjunction with the specific SFP module. Fiber cables can be classified in two types: Single Mode and Multimode. The main difference is the distance they are capable of covering and their diameter. Single Mode fibers cover greater distance compared to Multimode and has lower diameter (around 9 micrometer) while the Multimode fibers diameter is 50-62.5 micrometer. DAC cables for Direct Attach Copper Cable, on the other hand, can be used for short distances. They are mainly based on the Multimode-Standard type of transceivers due to the fact that the max distance they can cover is 15m. The AOC (Active Optical Cable), however, is a different story. When troubleshooting fiber connectivity related issues, it is important to make a distinction between SMF (Single Mode Fiber cables), and MMF (Multimode Fiber cables) and their corresponding SFP transceivers a given fiber can support. Cisco has matrix that we can refer to when trying to make a determination of the correct pairing. The following link provide some insight on Cisco 10gig SFP Example: The Cisco SFP-10G-SR only works with MMF type of cable of 62.5 micrometer diameter, while the Cisco SFP-10G-LR works only with SMF type of cable. The MMF range from OM1-OM5. OM is for Optical Multimode. OM1 type cables have a diameter of 62.5 micrometer, while all other types (OM2-OM5) have a diameter of 50 micrometer. So, it is important to know what is being done to avoid mixing them up.",

    "page_content": "To all show and more commands (except show technical support) an output modifier may be added as follows: <show/more command> | <output-modifier> <regular-expression-pattern> The output modifiers are: begin: Start output from the first line that has a sequence of characters matching thegiven regular expression pattern include: Includes only lines that have a sequence of characters matching the given regular expression pattern. exclude: Excludes all lines that have a sequence of characters matching the given regular expression pattern. count: Counts all lines that have a sequence of characters matching the given regular expression pattern and displays the result (no other output is displayed). Note Only 1 output modifier can be used in each command. The remainder of the text typed in is part of the regular expression pattern. A regular expression is a pattern (a phrase, number, or more complex pattern). The CLI String Search feature matches regular expressions to the show or more command output. Regular expressions are case-sensitive and allow for complex matching requirements. A regular expression can be a single-character pattern or a multiple-character pattern. That is, a regular expression can be a single character that matches the same single character in the command output or multiple characters that match the same multiple characters in the command output. The pattern in the command output is referred to as a string. This section describes creating both single-character patterns and multiple-character patterns. It also discusses creating more complex regular expressions, using multipliers, alternation, anchoring, and parentheses. Single-Character Patterns The simplest regular expression is a single character that matches the same single character in the command output. You can use any letter (A-Z, a-z) or digit (0-9) as a single-character pattern. You can also use other keyboard characters (such as ! or ~) as single-character patterns, but certain keyboard characters have special meaning when used in regular expressions. The following table lists the keyboard characters that have special meanings Character Meaning . Matches any single character, including white space. * Matches 0 or more sequences of the pattern. + Matches 1 or more sequences of the pattern. ? Matches 0 or 1 occurrences of the pattern. ^ Matches the beginning of the string. $ Matches the end of the string. To use these special characters as single-character patterns, remove the special meaning by preceding each character with a backslash (). The following examples are single-character patterns matching a dollar sign, an underscore, and a plus sign, respectively. $ _ + You can specify a range of single-character patterns to match against command output. For example, you can create a regular expression that matches a string containing one of the following letters: a, e, i, o, or u. Only one of these characters must exist in the string for pattern matching to succeed. To specify a range of single-character patterns, enclose the single-character patterns in square brackets ([ ]). For example, [aeiou] matches any one of the five vowels of the lowercase alphabet, while [abcdABCD] matches any one of the first four letters of the lower- or uppercase alphabet. You can simplify ranges by entering only the endpoints of the range separated by a dash (-). Simplify the previous range as follows: [a-dA-D] To add a dash as a single-character pattern in your range, include another dash and precede it with a backslash: [a-dA-D-] You can also include a right square bracket (]) as a single-character pattern in your range, as shown here: [a-dA-D-] The previous example matches any one of the first four letters of the lower- or uppercase alphabet, a dash, or a right square bracket. You can reverse the matching of the range by including a caret (^) at the start of the range. The following example matches any letter except the ones listed: [^a-dqsv] The following example matches anything except a right square bracket (]) or the letter d: [^]d] Multiple-Character Patterns When creating regular expressions, you can also specify a pattern containing multiple characters. You create multiple-character regular expressions by joining letters, digits, or keyboard characters that do not have special meaning. For example, a4% is a multiple-character regular expression. With multiple-character patterns, order is important. The regular expression a4% matches the character a followed by a 4 followed by a % sign. If the string does not have a4%, in that order, pattern matching fails. The multiple-character regular expression a. uses the special meaning of the period character to match the letter a followed by any single character. With this example, the strings ab, a!, or a2 are all valid matches for the regular expression. You can remove the special meaning of the period character by inserting a backslash before it. For example, when the expression a. is used in the command syntax, only the string a. will be matched. You can create a multiple-character regular expression containing all letters, all digits, all keyboard characters, or a combination of letters, digits, and other keyboard characters. For example, telebit 3107 v32bis is a valid regular expression. Multipliers You can create more complex regular expressions that instruct the system to match multiple occurrences of a specified regular expression. To do so, use some special characters with your single-character and multiple-character patterns. Table 1 lists the special characters that specify multiples of a regular expression. Table 1. Table 1: Special Characters Used as Multipliers Character Description * Matches 0 or more single-character or multiple-character patterns. + Matches 1 or more single-character or multiple-character patterns. ? Matches 0 or 1 occurrences of a single-character or multiple-character pattern. The following example matches any number of occurrences of the letter a, including none: a* The following pattern requires that at least one letter a be in the string to be matched: a+ The following pattern matches the string bb or bab: ba?b The following string matches any number of asterisks (*): * To use multipliers with multiple-character patterns, enclose the pattern in parentheses. In the following example, the pattern matches any number of the multiple-character string ab: (ab)* The following pattern matches one or more instances of alphanumeric pairs, but not none (that is, an empty string is not a match): ([A-Za-z][0-9])+ The order for matches using multipliers (*, +, or ?) is to put the longest construct first. Nested constructs are matched from outside to inside. Concatenated constructs are matched beginning at the left side of the construct. Thus, the regular expression above matches A9b3, but not 9Ab3 because the letters are specified before the numbers. Alternation Alternation allows you to specify alternative patterns to match against a string. You separate the alternative patterns with a vertical bar (|). Only one of the alternatives can match the string. For example, the regular expression codex|telebit either matches the string codex or the string telebit, but not both codex and telebit. Anchoring You can instruct the system to match a regular expression pattern against the beginning or the end of the string. You anchor these regular expressions to a portion of the string using the special characters shown in Table 2. Table 2. Table 2: Special Characters Used for Anchoring Character Description ^ Matches the beginning of the string. $ Matches the end of the string. For example, the regular expression ^con matches any string that starts with con, and $sole matches any string that ends with sole. In addition to indicating the beginning of a string, the ^ symbol can be used to indicate the logical function not when used in a bracketed range. For example, the expression [^abcd] indicates a range that matches any single letter, as long as it is not the letters a, b, c, or d.",

    "page_content": "To allow a single host (client) or multiple hosts on an IEEE 802.1X-authorized port, use the dot1x host-mode command in Interface Configuration mode. To restore the default configuration, use the no form of this command. Syntax dot1x host-mode {multi-host | single-host | multi-sessions} Parameters multi-host\u2014Enable multiple-hosts mode. single-host\u2014Enable single-hosts mode. multi-sessions\u2014Enable multiple-sessions mode. Default Configuration Default mode is multi-host. Command Mode Interface (Ethernet) Configuration mode User Guidelines Single-Host Mode The single-host mode manages the authentication status of the port: the port is authorized if there is an authorized host. In this mode, only a single host can be authorized on the port. When a port is unauthorized and the guest VLAN is enabled, untagged traffic is remapped to the guest VLAN. Tagged traffic is dropped unless the VLAN tag is the guest VLAN or the unauthenticated VLANs. If guest VLAN is not enabled on the port, only tagged traffic belonging to the unauthenticated VLANs is bridged. When a port is authorized, untagged and tagged traffic from the authorized host is bridged based on the static vlan membership configured at the port. Traffic from other hosts is dropped. A user can specify that untagged traffic from the authorized host will be remapped to a VLAN that is assigned by a RADIUS server during the authentication process. In this case, tagged traffic is dropped unless the VLAN tag is the RADIUS-assigned VLAN or the unauthenticated VLANs. The switch removes from FDB all MAC addresses learned on a port when its authentication status is changed from authorized to unauthorized. Multi-Host Mode The multi-host mode manages the authentication status of the port: the port is authorized after at least one host is authorized. When a port is unauthorized and the guest VLAN is enabled, untagged traffic is remapped to the guest VLAN. Tagged traffic is dropped unless the VLAN tag is the guest VLAN or the unauthenticated VLANs. If guest VLAN is not enabled on the port, only tagged traffic belonging to the unauthenticated VLANs is bridged. When a port is authorized, untagged and tagged traffic from all hosts connected to the port is bridged based on the static vlan membership configured at the port. A user can specify that untagged traffic from the authorized port will be remapped to a VLAN that is assigned by a RADIUS server during the authentication process. In this case, tagged traffic is dropped unless the VLAN tag is the RADIUS assigned VLAN or the unauthenticated VLANs. The switch removes from FDB all MAC addresses learned on a port when its authentication status is changed from authorized to unauthorized. Multi-Sessions Mode Unlike the single-host and multi-host modes (port-based modes) the multi-sessions mode manages the authentication status for each host connected to the port (session-based mode). If the multi-sessions mode is configured on a port the port does have any authentication status. Any number of hosts can be authorized on the port. The command can limit the maximum number of authorized hosts allowed on the port. Each authorized client requires a TCAM rule. If there is no available space in the TCAM, the authentication is rejected. When using the dot1x host-mode command to change the port mode to single-host or multi-host when authentication is enabled, the port state is set to unauthorized. If the dot1x host-mode command changes the port mode to multi-session when authentication is enabled, the state of all attached hosts is set to unauthorized. To change the port mode to single-host or multi-host, set the port (dot1x port-control) to force-unauthorized, change the port mode to single-host or multi-host, and set the port to authorization auto. Tagged traffic belonging to the unauthenticated VLANs is always bridged regardless if a host is authorized or not. When the guest VLAN is enabled, untagged and tagged traffic from unauthorized hosts not belonging to the unauthenticated VLANs is bridged via the guest VLAN. Traffic from an authorized hosts is bridged in accordance with the port static configuration. A user can specify that untagged and tagged traffic from the authorized host not belonging to the unauthenticated VLANs will be remapped to a VLAN that is assigned by a RADIUS server during the authentication process. The switch does not remove from FDB the host MAC address learned on the port when its authentication status is changed from authorized to unauthorized. The MAC address will be removed after the aging timeout expires. 802.1x enabled on a port associated with a port channel has the following limitations: Only the 802.1X-based authentication is supported. Only the multi-host (legacy 802.1x mode) mode is supported. Exampleswitchxxxxxx(config)  interface gi1/0/1 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  dot1x host-mode multi-host",

If the parameter is omitted, this option is applied by default. static\u2014If the RADIUS server authorized the supplicant, but did not provide a supplicant VLAN, the supplicant is accepted. Default Configuration reject Command Mode Interface (Ethernet) Configuration mode User Guidelines If RADIUS provides invalid VLAN information, the authentication is rejected. If a RADIUS server assigns a client with a non-existing VLAN, the switch creates the VLAN. The VLAN is removed when it is no longer being used. If RADIUS provides valid VLAN information and the port does not belong to the VLAN received from RADIUS, it is added to the VLAN as an egress untagged port. When the last authorized client assigned to the VLAN becomes unauthorized or 802.1x is disabled on the port, the port is excluded from the VLAN. If the authentication mode is single-host or multi-host, the value of PVID is set to the VLAN_ID. If an authorized port in the single-host or multi-host mode changes its status to unauthorized, the port static configuration is reset. If the authentication mode is multi-sessions mode, the PVID is not changed and all untagged traffic and tagged traffic not belonging to the unauthenticated VLANs are mapped to the VLAN using TCAM. If the last authorized host assigned to a VLAN received from RADIUS connected to a port in the multi-sessions mode changes its status to unauthorized, the port is removed from the VLAN if it is not in the static configuration. See the User Guidelines of the dot1x host-mode command for more information. If 802.1X is disabled the port static configuration is reset. If the reject keyword is configured and the RADIUS server authorizes the host but the RADIUS accept message does not assign a VLAN to the supplicant, authentication is rejected. If the static keyword is configured and the RADIUS server authorizes the host then even though the RADIUS accept message does not assign a VLAN to the supplicant, authentication is accepted and the traffic from the host is bridged in accordance with port static configuration. If this command is used when there are authorized ports/hosts, it takes effect at subsequent authentications. To manually re-authenticate, use the dot1x re-authenticate command. Examples Example 1.

The flags are concatenated to a one string. For example: +fin-ack. time-range-name\u2014Name of the time range that applies to this permit statement. (Range: 1\u201332) log-input\u2014Specifies sending an informational SYSLOG message about the packet that matches the entry. Because forwarding/dropping is done in hardware and logging is done in software, if a large number of packets match an ACE containing a log-input keyword, the software might not be able to match the hardware processing rate, and not all packets will be logged. Default Configuration No IPv4 access list is defined. Command Mode IP Access-list Configuration mode User Guidelines If a range of ports is used for source port in an ACE, it is not counted again, if it is also used for a source port in another ACE. If a range of ports is used for the destination port in an ACE, it is not counted again if it is also used for destination port in another ACE. If a range of ports is used for source port it is counted again if it is also used for destination port.

Default Configuration No IPv4 access list is defined. Command Mode IP Access-list Configuration mode User Guidelines The number of TCP/UDP ranges that can be defined in ACLs is limited. If a range of ports is used for a source port in ACE it is not counted again if it is also used for source port in another ACE. If a range of ports is used for destination port in ACE it is not counted again if it is also used for destination port in another ACE. If a range of ports is used for source port, it is counted again if it is also used for destination port. If ace-priority is omitted, the system sets the rule's priority to the current highest priority ACE (in the current ACL) + 20.

Syntax ipv6 access-list [acl-name] no ipv6 access-list [acl-name] Parameters acl-name\u2014Name of the IPv6 access list. Range 1-32 characters. Default Configuration No IPv6 access list is defined. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines IPv6 ACL is defined by a unique name. IPv4 ACL, IPv6 ACL, MAC ACL or policy maps cannot have the same name. Every IPv6 ACL has an implicit permit icmp any any nd-ns any, permit icmp any any nd-na any, and deny ipv6 any any statements as its last match conditions. (The former two match conditions allow for ICMPv6 neighbor discovery.) The IPv6 neighbor discovery process uses the IPv6 network layer service, therefore, by default, IPv6 ACLs implicitly allow IPv6 neighbor discovery packets to be sent and received on an interface. In IPv4, the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), which is equivalent to the IPv6 neighbor discovery process, uses a separate data link layer protocol; therefore, by default, IPv4 ACLs implicitly allow ARP packets to be sent and received on an interface.

Default Configuration No ACL is assigned. Default action for ACL is deny-any. Command Mode Interface Configuration mode (Ethernet, Port-Channel,VLAN ) User Guidelines The following rules govern when ACLs can be bound or unbound from an interface: IPv4 ACLs and IPv6 ACLs can be bound together to an interface. A MAC ACL cannot be bound on an interface which already has an IPv4 ACL or IPv6 ACL bound to it. Two ACLs of the same type cannot be bound to a port. An ACL cannot be bound to a port that is already bound to an ACL, without first removing the current ACL. Both ACLs must be mentioned at the same time in this command. MAC ACLs that include a VLAN as match criteria cannot be bound to a VLAN. ACLs with time-based configuration on one of its ACEs cannot be bound to a VLAN. ACLs with the action Shutdown cannot be bound to a VLAN. When the user binds ACL to an interface, TCAM resources will be consumed. One TCAM rule for each MAC or IP ACE and two TCAM rules for each IPv6 ACE.The TCAM consumption is always even number, so in case of odd number of rules the consumption will be increased by 1. An ACL cannot be bound as input if it has been bound as output.

Syntax ip access-list access-list-name {deny|permit} {src-addr[/src-len] | any} no ip access-list access-list-name Parameters access-list-name\u2014The name of the Standard IP access list. The name may contain maximum 32 characters. deny/permit\u2014Denies/permits access if the conditions are matched. src-addr[/src-len] | any\u2014 IP prefix defined as an IP address and length or any. The any value matches all IP addresses. If src-len is not defined, a value of 32 is applied. A value of src-len must be in the interval 1-32. Default Configuration No access list is defined. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines Use the ip access-list command to configure IP address filtering. Access lists are configured with permit or deny keywords to either permit or deny an IP address based on a matching condition. An implicit deny is applied to address that does not match any access-list entry. An access-list entry consists of an IP address and a bit mask. The bit mask is a number from 1 to 32. Evaluation of an IP address by an access list starts with the first entry of the list and continues down the list until a match is found. When the IP address match is found, the permit or deny statement is applied to that address and the remainder of the list is not evaluated. Use the no ip access-list command to delete the access list. The IPv4 standard access list is used to filter received and sent IPv4 routing information. Examples Examples Example 1 - The following example of a standard access list allows only the three specified networks. Any IP address that does not match the access list statements will be rejected. switchxxxxxx(config)  ip access-list 1 permit 192.168.34.0/24 switchxxxxxx(config)  ip access-list 1 permit 10.88.0.0/16 switchxxxxxx(config)  ip access-list 1 permit 10.0.0.0/8 Note: all other access is implicitly denied. Example 2 - The following example of a standard access list allows access for IP addresses in the range from 10.29.2.64 to 10.29.2.127. All IP addresses not in this range will be rejected. switchxxxxxx(config)  ip access-list apo permit 10.29.2.64/26 Note: all other access is implicitly denied. Example 3 - To specify a large number of individual addresses more easily, you can omit the mask length if it is 32. Thus, the following two configuration commands are identical in effect: switchxxxxxx(config)  ip access-list 2aa permit 10.48.0.3 switchxxxxxx(config)  ip access-list 2aa permit 10.48.0.3/32",

Otherwise, it is recommended to use the ipv4 mode, because there is no overlapping of IPv4 Multicast addresses in these modes.

In that case, no new FDB entry is created, but the port is added to the static (S,G) entries (if they exist) that belong to the requested group. It is recommended to set the FDB mode to ipv4-group or mac-group for IGMP version 2. If an application on the device requests (*,G), the operating FDB mode is changed to ipv4-group.

In the group address the last 4 bytes of the address are checked for match. In the source address the last 3 bytes and 5th from last bytes of the interface ID are examined. (*) Note that (*,G) cannot be written to the FDB if the mode is ip-src-group. In that case, no new FDB entry is created, but the port is added to the (S,G) entries (if they exist) that belong to the requested group.

(Range: 1\u20131000000) Default Configuration The feature is disabled by default. The default mode is discard. The default number of seconds is zero, but if traps is entered, a number of seconds must also be entered. Command Mode Interface (Ethernet, Port Channel) Configuration mode User Guidelines The command may be used only when the interface in the regular (non-secure with unlimited MAC learning) mode. Port Security cannot be enabled on an interface if 802.1X authentication is already active on the interface. When the port security command enables the lock mode on a port all dynamic addresses learned on the port are changed to permanent secure addresses. When the port security command enables a mode on a port differing from the lock mode all dynamic addresses learned on the port are deleted.

All aaa authentication enable requests sent by the device to a TACACS+ server include the username that is entered for login authentication.The additional methods of authentication are used only if the previous method returns an error, not if it fails. Specify none as the final method in the command line to ensure that the authentication succeeds even if all methods return an error. no aaa authentication enable list-name deletes list-name if it has not been referenced.

This method is usually used as fall back if the previous methods are not reachable. local Specifies that the local database should be used for commands authorization. This method is usually used as a fall back if the previous methods are not reachable. tacacs Uses the list of all TACACS+ servers for commands authorization. Default Configuration The Default method list exists, using none as the only method Command Mode Global configuration mode User Guidelines Use the aaa authorization commands command to specify a method list for authorizing commands executed by the user. If the method list includes more than one method, then the methods are used in the order specified in the command. A secondary method will be used only if the previous method is un-reachable. Command authorization will not be applied to a configuration mode command unless the aaa authorization config-commands is also configured on the device. Use the no form of the command to return the default method list to its default (none is the only method), or to delete a named method list that was created by the user. If local is defined as a method the commands will be authorized based on the credentials provided by the user and according to their privilege level. This means that a level 1 user will be able to execute all of the level 1 commands and a level 15 user will be able to execute all of the level 15 commands. If the credentials used for login are not part of the local database then execution for all of the commands will fail. This method is usually used as a backup in case the main method (for example tacacs) is not reachable. It prevents command execution lockout in this case. The none and if-authenticated are also used usually as backup method. If none is defined as a method \u2013 then the commands will always be authorized. The if-authenticated method functionality is similar to the none method functionality. However if the user did not provide any credentials when login in (for example authentication and authorization method list were none), then if none is defined as a command authorization list all commands will be authorized, and if the if-authenticated method is used all commands will be denied (since the user was not authenticated). In order to activate a method list it needs to be applied to a management interface (console, SSH or telnet) using the authorization commands line configuration mode command. Example The following example configures an authorization method list for level 15 commands. The authorization requests are sent to the list of the TACACS+ servers. If the TACACS+ servers do not respond, then the commands are still authorized (due to the none method). switchxxxxxx(config)  aaa authorization commands 15 auth_commands15 tacacs none",

The command is rejected if it is configured during a quiet-mode period. The no form of the command returns quiet-mode access-class to the default setting. On devices without a console the no command cannot be applied if login block-for command is configured. Examples Example 1 - The following example shows how to configure the device to accept connection during quiet mode period based on quiet-acl management access list: switchxxxxxx(config)  login quiet-mode access-class quiet-acl",

Character Repetition: A character cannot be repeated consecutively. The maximum number of repetition allowed is 3 by default. Minimum number of character classes: The number of different character classes that must be included in the password (classes are: uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number and special character). The minimum number is 3 by default and is configurable to 0-4 (0 and 1 are functionally identical). Any password established or altered by the user (hence \"Secret\") is compared to a list of common passwords. SecLists/Password Common Credentials If the secret contains a word from the list, the user will receive the following error message and will need to re-enter an alternative password: \"Password rejected- Passwords must not match words in the dictionary, and must not contain commonly used passwords\". Sequential characters \u2013 The password MUST NOT contain more than 2 sequential characters or numbers, or the reverse value of these sequences. Restriction also includes letters that are replaced with other characters, as follows: \"$\" for \"s\", \"@\" for \"a\", \"0\" for \"o\", \"1\" for \"l\", \"!\" for \"i\", \"3\" for \"e\". Examples for prohibited passwords: \u201cefg123!$\u201d, \u201cabcd765%\u201d, \u201ckji!$378\u201d, qr$58!230. Sequential letters are prohibited in any case combination (e.g. AbC or aBC). Context specific words (project and vendor name) \u2013 The password MUST NOT contain the username or the words \u201ccisco\u201d , \"catalyst\" or derivatives of such. This restriction includes these words reversed or in any case. Restriction also includes letters that are replaced with other characters, as follows: \"$\" for \"s\", \"@\" for \"a\", \"0\" for \"o\", \"1\" for \"l\", \"!\" for \"i\", \"3\" for \"e\", is not permitted. For example, C!$c0678! is not permitted. Known passwords are not allowed as passwords When the administrator configures a new enable password, this password is encrypted automatically and saved to the configuration file. No matter how the password was entered, it appears in the configuration file with the keyword encrypted and the encrypted value. The administrator is required to use the encrypted keyword only when actually entering an encrypted keyword. If the administrator wants to manually copy a password that was configured on one switch (for instance, switch B) to another switch (for instance, switch A), the administrator must add encrypted in front of this encrypted password when entering the enable command in switch A. In this way, the two switches will have the same password. The administrator is required to use the encrypted keyword only when actually entering an encrypted keyword. If the generate-password option is used, instead of entering a password the user will be presented with a randomly generated password suggestion. This suggestion will comply with all current password strength settings The user will be given the choice to accept or reject the proposed password. If the user elects to accept the password, then this password will be added for the configured enable level (in encrypted format) in the configuration file.

The range is from 1 to 160 characters. owner\u2014specifies the owner of the certificate. This is a string of 1 to 32 characters. If an owner is not specified, the default owner is \"Static\". When adding a certificate, the certificate itself should follow the command on the command line. Default Configuration There are no installed certificates. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines Use the ca-certificate install name command to install a CA certificate. Following the command, the user will be prompted to enter the certificate in the command line. The user will need to enter or paste the certificate. Entering a period on a separate line indicates that the certificate input is complete. The entered certificate must use the pem format. A certificate will not be valid if the system clock was not set by user or synchronized with SNTP, or based on hardware based Real Time Clock (RTC). Up to 256 certificates can be installed. When using the no form of the command to remove certificates, a specific certificate can be removed by name. Alternatively, the owner keyword can be used to remove all static certificates belonging to a specific owner. Examples Example 1.

Capabilities\u2014The device type of the neighbor. This device can be a router, a bridge, a transparent bridge, a source-routing bridge, a switch, a host, an IGMP device, or a repeater. COS for Untrusted Ports\u2014The COS value with which all packets received on an untrusted port should be marked by a simple switching device which cannot itself classify individual packets. Device ID\u2014The name of the neighbor device and either the MAC address or the serial number of this device. Duplex\u2014The duplex state of connection between the current device and the neighbor device. Entry address(es)\u2014A list of network addresses of neighbor devices. Extended Trust\u2014The Extended Trust. External Port-ID\u2014Identifies the physical connector port on which the CDP packet is transmitted. It is used in devices, such as those with optical ports, in which signals from multiple hardware interfaces are multiplexed through a single physical port. It contains the name of the external physical port through which the multiplexed signal is transmitted. Interface\u2014The protocol and port number of the port on the current device. IP Network Prefix\u2014It is used by On Demand Routing (ODR). When transmitted by a hub router, it is a default route (an IP address). When transmitted by a stub router, it is a list of network prefixes of stub networks to which the sending stub router can forward IP packets. Management Address\u2014When present, it contains a list of all the addresses at which the device will accept SNMP messages, including those it will only accept when received on interface(s) other than the one over which the CDP packet is being sent. MTU\u2014The MTU of the interface via which the CDP packet is sent. Native VLAN\u2014The ID number of the VLAN on the neighbor device. Physical Location\u2014A character string indicating the physical location of a connector which is on, or physically connected to, the interface over which the CDP packet containing this TLV is sent. Platform\u2014The product name and number of the neighbor device. In the case of the Secondary Cache only the 8 last characters of the value are printed. Power Available\u2014Every switch interface transmits information in the Power Available TLV, which permits a device which needs power to negotiate and select an appropriate power setting. The Power Available TLV includes four fields. Power Consumption\u2014The maximum amount of power, in milliwatts, expected to be obtained and consumed from the interface over which the CDP packet is sent. Power Drawn\u2014The maximum requested power. Note: For IP Phones the value shown is the maximum requested power (6.3 Watts). This value can be different than the actual power supplied by the routing device (generally 5 watts; shown using the show power command). Protocol-Hello\u2014Specifies that a particular protocol has asked CDP to piggyback its \"hello\" messages within transmitted CDP packets. Remote Port_ID\u2014Identifies the port the CDP packet is sent on sysName\u2014An ASCII string containing the same value as the sending device's sysName MIB object. sysObjectID\u2014The OBJECT-IDENTIFIER value of the sending device's sysObjectID MIB object. Time To Live\u2014The remaining amount of time, in seconds, the current device will hold the CDP advertisement from a transmitting router before discarding it. Version\u2014The software version running on the neighbor device. Voice VLAN-ID\u2014The Voice VLAN-ID. VTP Management Domain\u2014A string that is the name of the collective group of VLANs associated with the neighbor device.",

Default Configuration Full token information is displayed Command Mode User EXEC mode User Guidelines Use this command to display the tokens that can be used as part of the text parameter in commands ip dhcp information option circuit-id or ip dhcp information option remote-id. The tokens represent various system info, which the user can include in either of the sub-options\u2019 payloads. This allows automatic update of value based on current system information and also based on relevant interfaces. The tokens have meaningful and pre-determined names based on the information they represent. A $ symbol is placed before and after the Token name ($token-name$). Tokens can be divided, in general, into 3 groups: Tokens which represent interface level information (format of $int-xxx$); Tokens which represent switch level information (format of $switch-xxx$), and tokens which represent VLAN related information (format of $vlan-xxx$).

If this argument is configured, client messages are forwarded to the well-known link-local Multicast address All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers (FF02:1:2) through the link to which the output interface is connected. Default Configuration The relay function is disabled, and there is no relay destination on an interface. Command Mode Interface Configuration mode User Guidelines This command specifies a destination address to which client messages are forwarded, and it enables DHCP for IPv6 relay service on the interface. Up to 10 addresses can be defined per one interface and up to 100 addresses can be defined per switch. DHCPv6 Relay inserts the Interface-id option if an IPv6 global address is not defined on the interface on which the relay is running. The Interface-id field of the option is the interface name (a value of the ifName field of the ifTable) on which the relay is running. When relay service is running on an interface, a DHCP for IPv6 message received on that interface will be forwarded to all configured relay destinations configured per interface and globally. The incoming DHCP for IPv6 message may have come from a client on that interface, or it may have been relayed by another relay agent. The relay destination can be a Unicast address of a server or another relay agent, or it may be a Multicast address. There are two types of relay destination addresses: A link-local Unicast or Multicast IPv6 address, for which a user must specify an output interface A global Unicast IPv6 address. A user can optionally specify an output interface for this kind of address. If no output interface is configured for a destination, the output interface is determined by routing tables. In this case, it is recommended that a Unicast or Multicast routing protocol be running on the router. Multiple destinations can be configured on one interface, and multiple output interfaces can be configured for one destination. When the relay agent relays messages to a Multicast address, it sets the hop limit field in the IPv6 packet header to 32. Unspecified, loopback, and node-local Multicast addresses are not acceptable as the relay destination. Note that it is not necessary to enable the relay function on an interface for it to accept and forward an incoming relay reply message from servers. By default, the relay function is disabled, and there is no relay destination on an interface. Use the no form of the command with arguments to remove a specific address. Use the no form of the command without arguments to remove all the defined addresses and to disable the relay on the interface. Examples Example 1. The following example sets the relay Unicast link-local destination address per VLAN 200 and enables the DHCPv6 Relay on VLAN 100 if it was not enabled: switchxxxxxx(config)  interface vlan 100 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  ipv6 dhcp relay destination FE80:1:2 vlan 200 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  exitExample 2.

If this source is selected, the destination can only be USB. If specified filename does not include the \".zip\" suffix, this suffix will be added automatically to copied filename (full path length up to 160 characters). Command Mode Privileged EXEC mode User Guidelines The following guidelines are relevant: You cannot copy one network file to another network file. Localization is not supported as a predefined src-url or dst-url. Use the copy src-url dst-url command to copy any file. If the dst-url argument defines an existed flash file the command fails if this file does not have the writable permission. If the dst-url argument defines a directory file then the file is copied into the directory with the same name. No file format validation or conversion is performed. If the src-url argument and dst-url arguments define flash files the dst-url file will have the permissions of the src-url file. If the src-url argument defines a non-flash file and the dst-url argument defines a flash files the dst-url file will have the following permissions: readable writable Use the copy src-url running-config command to add a file to the Running Configuration file. Examples Example 1. The following example copies file file1 from the TFTP server 172.16.101.101 to the flash:/aaa/file1 file: switchxxxxxx  copy tftp:/172.16.101.101/file1 flash:/aaa/file1 Example 2.

This command controls how much time the hosts have to answer an IGMP query message before the router deletes their group. Configuring a value of fewer than 10 seconds enables the router to prune groups faster. The maximum query response time must be less than the query interval. Note. If the hosts do not respond fast enough, they might be pruned inadvertently. Therefore, the hosts must know to respond faster than 10 seconds (or the value you configure).

During this time, if the switch did not receive an IGMP query from another Querier - it starts sending General Query messages. Once the switch acts as a Querier, it will stop sending General Query messages if it detects another Querier on the VLAN. In this case, the switch will resume sending General Query messages if it does hear another Querier for Query Passive interval that equals to <Robustness>*<Query Interval> + 0.5*<Query Response Interval). It is recommended to disable IGMP Querier election mechanism if there is an IPM Multicast router on the VLAN. Example The following example disables IGMP Snooping Querier election on VLAN 1:switchxxxxxx(config)  no ip igmp snooping vlan 1 querier election",

Command Mode Interface (Ethernet, Port Channel, Bluetooth) Configuration mode User Guidelines Use the ip address command to define a static IP address on an interface. In-Band interfaces Multiple IP addresses are supported. A new defined IP address is added on the interface. Defining a static IP address on an interface stops a DHCP client running on the interface and removes the IP address assigned by the DHCP client. If a configured IP address overlaps another configured one a warning message is displayed. To change an existed IP address, delete the existed one and add the new one. While no IP address is assigned either by DHCP client or manually the default IP address 192.168.1.254 is assigned on the Default VLAN. Bluetooth interface One IP address is supported. A new IP address defined on the Bluetooth interface overrides the previously defined IP address. The IP address configured on the Bluetooth interface cannot be on the same subnet as the addresses configured on the In-Band interfaces. The IP address on the Bluetooth interface does not support routing capabilities. Examples Example 1.

Command Mode Global Configuration mode Default Configuration No permanent entry is defined. If no interface ID is entered, address pair is relevant to all interfaces. User Guidelines The software uses ARP cache entries to translate 32-bit IP addresses into 48-bit hardware (MAC) addresses. Because most hosts support dynamic address resolution, static ARP cache entries generally do not need to be specified. Example The following example adds IP address 198.133.219.232 and MAC address 00:00:0c:40:0f:bc to the ARP table.switchxxxxxx(config)  arp 198.133.219.232 00:00:0c:40:0f:bc vlan100",

If udp-port-list is not specified, packets for the default services are forwarded to the helper address. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines This command forwards specific UDP Broadcast packets from one interface to another, by specifying a UDP port number to which UDP broadcast packets with that destination port number are forwarded. By default, if no UDP port number is specified, the device forwards UDP broadcast packets for the following six services: IEN-116 Name Service (port 42) DNS (port 53) NetBIOS Name Server (port 137) NetBIOS Datagram Server (port 138) TACACS Server (port 49) Note TACACS is not supported on the C1200 models. Time Service (port 37) Many helper addresses may be defined. However, the total number of address-port pairs is limited to 128 for the device. The setting of a helper address for a specific interface has precedence over the setting of a helper address for all the interfaces. Forwarding of BOOTP/DHCP (ports 67, 68) cannot be enabled with this command. Use the DHCP relay commands to relay BOOTP/DHCP packets. The ip-interface argument cannot be the OOB port.

This mask is applied to the host-ip parameter to determine the actual source IP to use on each VLAN. Default Configuration 0.0.0.0 is used as the source IP address for probes that are sent on VLAN interfaces without an IP address. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines ARP Probes sent by Layer 3 interfaces use the Interface\u2019s IP address as the source IP address for ARP probes sent by IP device tracking mechanism. This includes IP addresses configured on physical interfaces, Port-channels or VLANs By default, the source IP address of ARP probes sent by a Layer 2 VLAN (a VLAN not configured with an IP address) is 0.0.0.0. Use the ip device tracking probe auto-source command to change the source address used by L2 VLANs. The host-ip parameter defines the IP address to use as the ARP Probe source IP address. The mask parameter defines which bits in the host-ip parameter should be used as the ARP probe source IP, where 1 indicates \u201cdon't use\u201d (or masked) and 0 indicates \u201cuse\u201d. The mask part of the IP address is taken from the IP address of the endpoint to which the ARP probe is sent. The mask must be contiguous from the high order bit (e.g 255.255.0.0 is a valid mask while 0.0.255.255 is not a valid mask) Here are a few examples, where the ARP probe needs to be sent to 2 hosts: 10.10.1.100 and 20.1.1.100. The address segment taken from the host IP is highlighted: When the following command was specified: ip device tracking probe auto-source fallback 0.0.0.1 255.255.255.0 override: The source IP address used in the ARP probe sent to host 10.10.1.100 will be \u2013 10.10.1.1 The source IP address used in the ARP probe sent to host 20.1.1.100 will be \u2013 20.1.1.1 When the following command was specified: ip device tracking probe auto-source fallback 0.0.2.1 255.255.0.0 override: The source IP address used in the ARP probe sent to host 10.10.1.100 will be \u2013 10.10.2.1 The source IP address used in the ARP probe sent to host 20.1.1.100 will be \u2013 20.1.2.1 20.1.1.1 When the following command was specified: ip device tracking probe auto-source fallback 0.3.2.1 255.0.0.0 override The source IP address used in the ARP probe sent to host 10.10.1.100 will be \u2013 10.3.2.1 The source IP address used in the ARP probe sent to host 20.1.1.100 will be \u2013 20.3.2.1 Examples The following example specifies that the probe source IP address will use the first 3 bytes of the network address and the value of 11 for the host segment (last byte): switchxxxxxx(config)  ip device tracking probe auto-source fallback 0.0.0.11 255.255.255.0 override",

Command Mode Key Chain Key Configuration mode User Guidelines The switch checks Time-of-Date again a value of the start-time argument regardless if Time-of-Date is not set by management or by SNTP because of the default value of Time-of-Date always is an passed time. If validation of the value of the start-time argument was passed and the end-time argument is configured and its value is infinite the key is considered as actual regardless if Time-of-Date is not set by management or by SNTP. If Time-of-Date is not set by management or by SNTP and if the end-time argument is configured with a value differing from infinite or the duration parameter is configured, the key is considered as expired. If Time-of-Date is set by management or by SNTP, the switch checks Time-of-Date again a value of the end-time argument or of the duration parameter. If the last key expires, authentication will be finished with error. Example The following example configures a key chain called keychain1. The key named string1 will be accepted from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. and be sent from 2:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. The key named string2 will be accepted from 2:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. and be sent from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. The overlap allows for migration of keys or discrepancies in the set time of the router.

Default Configuration The cryptographic algorithm is not set by default. Command Mode Key Chain Key Configuration mode User Guidelines Configuring the cryptographic-algorithm command defines the algorithm to use for each key in the key-chain. The same algorithm must be configured for the same key ID on the link partner interface. Configuring a cryptographic algorithm for a key is mandatory for OSPF key-chain based authentication (command ip ospf authentication with key-chain option). If a key-chain used for OSPF authentication includes a key-id not configured with a cryptographic algorithm, then: If this is the only key in the key-chain, then OSPF packets are not sent on the IP interface and OSPF packets received on the IP interface are dropped. If the key-chain includes additional keys then only the keys configured with a cryptographic algorithm will be used. If a certain time-range (commands accept-lifetime or send-lifetime) is covered only by the key without a cryptographic algorithm, then during this time-range OSPF packets are not sent on the IP interface and OSPF packets received on the IP interface are dropped. RIP key-chain based authentication (command ip rip authentication key-chain) supports only MD5 authentication. Therefore: If a \"cryptographic-algorithm\" was not configured for a key, then RIP authentication will use the specified key using the MD5 algorithm. If a \"cryptographic-algorithm\" was used to configure MD5 algorithm for a key, then RIP authentication will use the specified key using the MD5 algorithm. If a \"cryptographic-algorithm\" was used to configure any other (non MD5) algorithm for a key, then the key will not be used for RIP authentication. Example The following example configures a key chain called keychain1, with a key named string1. The cryptographic algorithm is set to hmac-sha-256: switchxxxxxx(config)  key chain keychain1 switchxxxxxx(config-keychain)  key 1 switchxxxxxx(config-keychain-key)  key-string string1 switchxxxxxx(config-keychain-key)  cryptographic-algorithm hmac-sha-256 switchxxxxxx(config-keychain-key)  exit",

The key identification numbers need not be consecutive. The scope of a key identification number is the key chain where the key is defined. Default Configuration No key exists on the key chain. Command Mode Key-Chain Configuration mode User Guidelines It is useful to have multiple keys on a key chain so that the software can sequence through the keys as they become invalid after time, based on the accept-lifetime and send-lifetime key chain key command settings. Each key has its own key identifier, which is stored locally. The combination of the key identifier and the interface associated with the message uniquely identifies the authentication algorithm and authentication key in use. Only one authentication packet is sent, regardless of the number of valid keys. The software starts looking at the lowest key identifier number and uses the first valid key. If the last key expires, authentication will be finished with error. To remove all keys, remove the key chain by using the no key chain command. Example The following example configures a key chain named chain1. The key named key1 will be accepted from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. and be sent from 2:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. The key named key2 will be accepted from 2:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. and be sent from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. The overlap allows for migration of keys or a discrepancy in the set time of the router.

The syntax can be either of the following: hh:mm:ss Month date year hh:mm:ss date Month year hh\u2014hours (0-23) mm\u2014minutes (0-59) ss\u2014seconds (0-59) Month\u2014first three letters of the month date\u2014date (1-31) year\u2014year (four digits) The default start time and the earliest acceptable date is January 1, 2000. infinite\u2014Key is valid to be received from the start-time value on. end-time\u2014Key is valid to be received from the start-time value until the end-time value. The syntax is the same as that for the start-time value. The end-time value must be after the start-time value. The default end time is an infinite time period. duration seconds\u2014Length of time (in seconds) that the key is valid to be received. The range is from 1 to 2147483646. Default Configuration The default time period during which the authentication key is valid for authenticating incoming packets is set to forever. Forever (the starting time is January 1, 2000, and the ending time is infinite) Command Mode Key Chain Key Configuration mode User Guidelines Specify a start-time value and one of the following values: infinite end-time, or duration seconds. A key is considered as expired if Time-of-Date is not set by management or by SNTP. If the last key expires, authentication will be finished with error. Example The following example configures a key chain called chain1. The key named key1 will be accepted from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. and be sent from 2:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. The key named key2 will be accepted from 2:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. and be sent from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. The overlap allows for migration of keys or discrepancies in the set time of the router.

(Range: Valid IP address) Command Mode Privileged EXEC mode User Guidelines The traceroute command works by taking advantage of the error messages generated by routers when a datagram exceeds its time-to-live (TTL) value. The traceroute command starts by sending probe datagrams with a TTL value of one. This causes the first router to discard the probe datagram and send back an error message. The traceroute command sends several probes at each TTL level and displays the round-trip time for each. The traceroute command sends out one probe at a time. Each outgoing packet can result in one or two error messages. A \"time exceeded\u201d error message indicates that an intermediate router has seen and discarded the probe. A \"destination unreachable\" error message indicates that the destination node has received the probe and discarded it because it could not deliver the packet. If the timer goes off before a response comes in, the traceroute command prints an asterisk (*). The traceroute command terminates when the destination responds, when the maximum TTL is exceeded, or when the user interrupts the trace with Esc. The traceroute ipv6 command is not relevant to IPv6 link local addresses. Exampleswitchxxxxxx> traceroute ip umaxp1.physics.lsa.umich.edu Type Esc to abort.

A decimal value that indicates how many of the high-order contiguous bits of the address comprise the prefix (the network portion of the address). A slash mark must precede the decimal value. Default Configuration No IP address is defined for the interface. Command Mode Interface Configuration mode User Guidelines An Anycast address is an address that is assigned to a set of interfaces that typically belong to different nodes. A packet sent to an Anycast address is delivered to the closest interface\u2014as defined by the routing protocols in use\u2014identified by the Anycast address. Anycast addresses are syntactically indistinguishable from Unicast addresses because Anycast addresses are allocated from the Unicast address space. Nodes to which the Anycast address is assigned must be explicitly configured to recognize that the address is an Anycast address. Anycast addresses can be used only by a router, not a host, and Anycast addresses must not be used as the source address of an IPv6 packet. The subnet router Anycast address has a prefix concatenated by a series of zeros (the interface ID). The subnet router Anycast address can be used to reach a router on the link that is identified by the prefix in the subnet router Anycast address.

Command Mode Interface Configuration mode User Guidelines This command enables IPv6 on an interface (if it was disabled) and causes the switch to perform IPv6 stateless address auto-configuration to discover prefixes on the link and then to add the eui-64 based addresses to the interface. Stateless auto configuration is applied only when IPv6 Forwarding is disabled. When IPv6 forwarding is changed from disabled to enabled, and stateless auto configuration is enabled the switch stops stateless auto configuration and removes all stateless auto configured ipv6 addresses from all interfaces. When IPv6 forwarding is changed from enabled to disabled and stateless auto configuration is enabled the switch resumes stateless auto configuration. Additionally the ipv6 address autoconfig command enables on the interface the DHCPv6 Stateless client to receive DHCP stateless information and this information is received from a DHCPv6 server regardless whether IPv6 Forwarding is enabled or not. Example The following example assigns the IPv6 address automatically:switchxxxxxx(config)  interface vlan 100 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  ipv6 address autoconfig switchxxxxxx(config-if)  exit",

Syntax ipv6 address ipv6-prefix/prefix-length eui-64 no ipv6 address [ipv6-prefix/prefix-length eui-64] Parameters ipv6-prefix\u2014Specifies the global unicast IPv6 address assigned to the interface. This argument must be in the form documented in RFC4293 where the address is specified in hexadecimal using 16-bit values between colons. prefix-length\u2014The length of the IPv6 prefix. A decimal value that indicates how many of the high-order contiguous bits of the address comprise the prefix (the network portion of the address). A slash mark must precede the decimal value. Default Configuration No IP address is defined for the interface. Command Mode Interface Configuration mode User Guidelines If the value specified for the prefix-length argument is greater than 64 bits, the prefix bits have precedence over the interface ID. The IPv6 address is built from ipv6-prefix and the EUI-64 Interface ID by the following way: The first prefix-length bits are taken from ipv6-prefix. If prefix-length < 64 then The following (64-prefix-length) bits are filled by 0s. The last 64 bits are taken from the EUI-64 Interface ID. If prefix-length equals to 64 then the following 64 bits are taken from the EUI-64 Interface ID.

Configuring a value of 0 disables duplicate address detection processing on the specified interface; a value of 1 configures a single transmission without follow-up transmissions. Default Configuration 1 Command Mode Interface Configuration mode User Guidelines Duplicate address detection verifies the uniqueness of new Unicast IPv6 addresses before the addresses are assigned to interfaces (the new addresses remain in a tentative state while duplicate address detection is performed). Duplicate address detection uses neighbor solicitation messages to verify the uniqueness of Unicast IPv6 addresses. The DupAddrDetectTransmits node configuration variable (as specified in RFC 4862, IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration) is used to automatically determine the number of consecutive neighbor solicitation messages that are sent on an interface, while duplicate address detection is performed on a tentative Unicast IPv6 address. The interval between duplicate address detection, neighbor solicitation messages (the duplicate address detection timeout interval) is specified by the neighbor discovery-related variable RetransTimer (as specified in RFC 4861, Neighbor Discovery for IPv6), which is used to determine the time between retransmissions of neighbor solicitation messages to a neighbor when resolving the address or when probing the reachability of a neighbor. This is the same management variable used to specify the interval for neighbor solicitation messages during address resolution and neighbor unreachability detection. Duplicate address detection is suspended on interfaces that are administratively down. While an interface is administratively down, the Unicast IPv6 addresses assigned to the interface are set to a pending state. Duplicate address detection is automatically restarted on an interface when the interface returns to being administratively up. An interface returning to administratively up, restarts duplicate address detection for all of the Unicast IPv6 addresses on the interface. While duplicate address detection is performed on the link-local address of an interface, the state for the other IPv6 addresses is still set to TENTATIVE. When duplicate address detection is completed on the link-local address, duplicate address detection is performed on the remaining IPv6 addresses. When duplicate address detection identifies a duplicate address, the state of the address is set to DUPLICATE and the address is not used. If the duplicate address is the link-local address of the interface, the processing of IPv6 packets is disabled on the interface and an error SYSLOG message is issued. If the duplicate address is a global address of the interface, the address is not used and an error SYSLOG message is issued. All configuration commands associated with the duplicate address remain as configured while the state of the address is set to DUPLICATE. If the link-local address for an interface changes, duplicate address detection is performed on the new link-local address and all of the other IPv6 address associated with the interface are regenerated (duplicate address detection is performed only on the new link-local address). Note. Since DAD is not supported on NBMA interfaces the command is allowed but does not impact on an IPv6 tunnel interface of the ISATAP type it does not impact. The configuration is saved and will impacted when the interface type is changed on another type on which DAD is supported (for example, to the IPv6 manual tunnel). Example The following example configures five consecutive neighbor solicitation messages to be sent on VLAN 1 while duplicate address detection is being performed on the tentative Unicast IPv6 address of the interface. The example also disables duplicate address detection processing on VLAN 2. switchxxxxxx(config)  interface vlan 1 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  ipv6 nd dad attempts 5 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  exit switchxxxxxx(config)  interface vlan 2 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  ipv6 nd dad attempts 0 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  exit",

This argument must be in the form documented in RFC4293, where the address is specified in hexadecimal using 16-bit values between colons. prefix-length\u2014Length of the IPv6 prefix. A decimal value that indicates how many of the high-order contiguous bits of the address comprise the prefix (the network portion of the address). A slash mark must precede the decimal value. default\u2014Default values used for automatic advertised prefixes configured as addresses on the interface using the ipv6 address command. no-advertise\u2014Prefix is not advertised. valid-lifetime\u2014Remaining length of time, in seconds, that this prefix will continue to be valid, i.e., time until invalidation. A value of 4,294,967,295 represents infinity. The address generated from an invalidated prefix should not appear as the destination or source address of a packet. preferred-lifetime\u2014Remaining length of time, in seconds, that this prefix will continue to be preferred, i.e., time until deprecation. A value of 4,294,967,295 represents infinity. The address generated from a deprecated prefix should no longer be used as a source address in new communications, but packets received on such an interface are processed as expected. The preferred-lifetime must not be larger than the valid-lifetime. no-autoconfig\u2014Indicates to hosts on the local link that the specified prefix cannot be used for IPv6 autoconfiguration.The prefix will be advertised with the A-bit clear. off-link\u2014Configures the specified prefix as off-link. The prefix will be advertised with the L-bit clear. The prefix will not be inserted into the routing table as a connected prefix. If the prefix is already present in the routing table as a connected prefix (for example, because the prefix was also configured using the ipv6 address command), then it will be removed. no-onlink\u2014Configures the specified prefix as not on-link. The prefix will be advertised with the L-bit clear. Default Configuration All prefixes configured on interfaces that originate IPv6 router advertisements are advertised with a valid lifetime of 2,592,000 seconds (30 days) and a preferred lifetime of 604,800 seconds (7 days). Note that by default: All prefixes are inserted in the routing table as connected prefixes. All prefixes are advertised as on-link (for example, the L-bit is set in the advertisement) All prefixes are advertised as an auto-configuration prefix (for example, the A-bit is set in the advertisement) Command Mode Interface Configuration mode User Guidelines This command enables control over the individual parameters per prefix, including whether the prefix should be advertised. Use the ipv6 nd prefix ipv6-prefix/prefix-length command to add the prefix to the Prefix table. Use the no ipv6 nd prefix ipv6-prefix/prefix-length command to remove the prefix from the Prefix table. Use the no ipv6 nd prefix command without the ipv6-prefix/prefix-length argument o remove all prefixes from the Prefix Table. Note. The no ipv6 nd prefix command does not return the default values to the original default values. The switch supports the following advertisement algorithm: Advertise all prefixes that are configured as addresses on the interface using the parameters defined by the ipv6 nd prefix default command (or the default value if the command has not been configured) except refixes that are placed in the Prefix table (changed (configured) by the ipv6 nd prefix command). Advertise all prefixes configured by the ipv6 nd prefix command without the no-advertise keyword. Default Keyword The default keyword can be used to set default values for automatic advertised prefixes configured as addresses on the interface using the ipv6 address command. Note. These default values are not used as the default values in the ipv6 nd prefix command. Use the no ipv6 nd prefix default command to return the default values to the original default values. On-Link When on-link is \u201con\u201d (by default), the specified prefix is assigned to the link. Nodes sending traffic to such addresses that contain the specified prefix consider the destination to be locally reachable on the link. An on-link prefix is inserted into the routing table as a Connected prefix. Auto-configuration When auto-configuration is on (by default), it indicates to hosts on the local link that the specified prefix can be used for IPv6 auto-configuration. The configuration options affect the L-bit and A-bit settings associated with the prefix in the IPv6 ND Router Advertisement, and presence of the prefix in the routing table, as follows: Default L=1 A=1, In the Routing Table no-onlink L=0 A=1, In the Routing Table no-autoconfig L=1 A=0, In the Routing Table no-onlink no-autoconfig L=0 A=0, In the Routing Table off-link L=0 A=1, Not in the Routing Table off-link no-autoconfig L=0 A=0, Not in the Routing Table Examples Example 1.

If you specify an optional interface identifier, the command displays information only about that specific interface. For a specific interface, you can enter the prefix keyword to see the IPv6 neighbor discovery (ND) prefixes that are configured on the interface. The keyword is supported only if IPv6 unicast routing is enabled. Examples Example 1. The show ipv6 interface command displays information about the specified interface: switchxxxxxx  show ipv6 interface vlan 1 VLAN 1 is up/up IPv6 is enabled, link-local address is FE80:0DB8:12AB:FA01 IPv6 Forwarding is enabled Global unicast address(es): Ipv6 Global Address Type 2000:0DB8:2/64 (ANY) Manual 2000:0DB8:2/64 Manual 2000:1DB8:2011/64 Manual Joined group address(es): FF02:1 FF02:2 FF02:1:FF11:6770 MTU is 1500 bytes ICMP error messages limited interval is 100ms; Bucket size is 10 tokens ICMP redirects are enabled ND DAD is enabled, number of DAD attempts: 1 ND reachable time is 30000 milliseconds ND advertised reachable time is 0 milliseconds ND advertised retransmit interval is 0 milliseconds ND router maximum advertisement interval is 600 seconds ND router minimum advertisement interval is 198 seconds (DEFAULT) ND router advertisements live for 1800 seconds ND advertised default router preference is Medium Stateless autoconfiguration is enabled.

Each policy of the same type (for example, IPv6 First Hop Security policies) must have a unique name. Policies of different types can have the same policy name.

It is the lowest value of a range of the length (the \u201cfrom\u201d portion of the length range). le le-value\u2014Specifies a prefix length less than or equal to the /prefix-length argument. It is the highest value of a range of the length (the \u201cto\u201d portion of the length range). Default Configuration No prefix list is created. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines This command without the seq keyword adds the new entry after the last entry of the prefix list with the sequence number equals to the last number plus 5. For example, if the last configured sequence number is 43, the new entry will have the sequence number of 48. If the list is empty, the first prefix-list entry is assigned the number 5 and subsequent prefix list entries increment by 5. This command with the seq keyword puts the new entry into the place specified by the parameter, if an entry with the number exists it is replaced by the new one. This command without the seq keyword removes the prefix list. The no version of this command with the seq keyword removes the specified entry. The sequence number of a prefix list entry determines the order of the entries in the list. The router compares network addresses to the prefix list entries. The router begins the comparison at the top of the prefix list, with the entry having the lowest sequence number. If multiple entries of a prefix list match a prefix, the entry with the lowest sequence number is considered the real match. Once a match or deny occurs, the router does not go through the rest of the prefix list. For efficiency, you might want to put the most common permits or denies near the top of the list, using the seq-number argument. IPv6 prefix lists are used to specify certain prefixes or a range of prefixes that must be matched before a permit or deny statement can be applied. Two operand keywords can be used to designate a range of prefix lengths to be matched. A prefix length of less than, or equal to, a value is configured with the le keyword. A prefix length greater than, or equal to, a value is specified using the ge keyword. The ge and le keywords can be used to specify the range of the prefix length to be matched in more detail than the usual ipv6-prefix/prefix-length argument. For a candidate prefix to match against a prefix list entry the following conditions must exist: The candidate prefix must match the specified prefix list and prefix length entry The value of the optional le keyword specifies the range of allowed prefix lengths from 0 up to the value of the le-length argument, and including, this value. The value of the optional ge keyword specifies the range of allowed prefix lengths from the value of the ge-length argument up to, and including, 128. Note that the first condition must match before the other conditions take effect. An exact match is assumed when the ge or le keywords are not specified. If only one keyword operand is specified then the condition for that keyword is applied, and the other condition is not applied. The prefix-length value must be less than the ge value. The ge value must be less than, or equal to, the le value. The le value must be less than or equal to 128. Every IPv6 prefix list, including prefix lists that do not have permit and deny condition statements, has an implicit deny any any statement as its last match condition. Formal Specification Checked prefix is cP and checked prefix length is cL. Function PrefixIsEqual(P1, P2, L) compares the first L bits of two addresses P1 and P2 and returns TRUE if they are equal. Case 1. A prefix-list entry is: P - prefix address L - prefix length ge - is not defined le - is not defined The prefix cP/cL matches the prefix-list entry if PrefixIsEqual(cP,P,L) & cL = L Case 2. An prefix-list entry is: P - prefix address L - prefix length ge - is defined le - is not defined The prefix cP/cL matches the prefix-list entry if PrefixIsEqual(cP,P,L) & cL >= ge Case 3. An prefix-list entry is: P - prefix address L - prefix length ge - is not defined le - is defined The prefix cP/cL matches to the prefix-list entry if PrefixIsEqual(cP,P,L) & cL <= le Case 4. An prefix-list entry is: P - prefix address L - prefix length ge - is defined le - is defined The prefix cP/cL matches the prefix-list entry if PrefixIsEqual(cP,P,L) & ge <= cL <= le Examples Example 1. The following example denies all routes with a prefix of :/0: switchxxxxxx(config)  ipv6 prefix-list abc deny :/0 Example 2. The following example permits the prefix 2002:/16: switchxxxxxx(config)  ipv6 prefix-list abc permit 2002:/16 Example 3. The following example shows how to specify a group of prefixes to accept any prefixes from prefix 5F00:/48 up to and including prefix 5F00:/64: switchxxxxxx(config)  ipv6 prefix-list abc permit 5F00:/48 le 64 Example 4. The following example denies prefix lengths greater than 64 bits in routes that have the prefix 2001:0DB8:/64: switchxxxxxx(config)  ipv6 prefix-list abc permit 2001:0DB8:/64 le 128 Example 5. The following example permits mask lengths from 32 to 64 bits in all address space: switchxxxxxx(config)  ipv6 prefix-list abc permit :/0 ge 32 le 64 Example 6. The following example denies mask lengths greater than 32 bits in all address space: switchxxxxxx(config)  ipv6 prefix-list abc deny :/0 ge 32 Example 7. The following example denies all routes with a prefix of 2002:/128: switchxxxxxx(config)  ipv6 prefix-list abc deny 2002:/128 Example 8. The following example permits all routes with a prefix of :/0: switchxxxxxx(config)  ipv6 prefix-list abc permit :/0",

If there are no dynamic addresses, the software selects the lowest IP address among the static IP addresses. automatic interface-id\u2014Specifies that the software automatically selects a management address to advertise from the IP addresses that are configured on the interface ID. In case of multiple IP addresses, the software selects the lowest IP address among the dynamic IP addresses of the interface. If there are no dynamic addresses, the software selects the lowest IP address among the static IP addresses of the interface. The interface ID can be one of the following types: Ethernet port, port-channel or VLAN. Note that if the port or port- channel are members in a VLAN that has an IP address, that address is not included because the address is associated with the VLAN. Default Configuration No IP address is advertised. The default advertisement is automatic. Command Mode Interface (Ethernet) Configuration mode User Guidelines Each port can advertise one IP address. Example The following example sets the LLDP management address advertisement mode to automatic on gi1/0/2. switchxxxxxx(config)  interface gi1/0/2 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  lldp management-address automatic",

    "page_content": "Use the macro name Global Configuration mode command to define a macro. There are two types of macros that can be defined: Global macros define a group of CLI commands that can be run at any time. Smartport macros are associated with Smartport types. For each Smartport macro there must be an anti macro (a macro whose name is concatenated with no_). The anti macro reverses the action of the macro. If a macro with this name already exists, it overrides the previously-defined one. Use the no form of this command to delete the macro definition. Syntax macro name macro-name no macro name [macro-name] Parameters macro-name\u2014Name of the macro. Macro names are case sensitive. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines A macro is a script that contains CLI commands and is assigned a name by the user. It can contain up to 3000 characters and 200 lines. Keywords Macros may contain keywords (parameters). The following describes these keywords: A macro can contain up to three keywords. All matching occurrences of the keyword are replaced by the corresponding value specified in the macro command. Keyword matching is case-sensitive Applying a macro with keywords does not change the state of the original macro definition. User Feedback The behavior of a macro command requiring user feedback is the same as if the command is entered from terminal: it sends its prompt to the terminal and accepts the user reply. Creating a Macro Use the following guidelines to create a macro: Use macro name to create the macro with the specified name. Enter one macro command per line. Use the @ character to end the macro. Use the   character at the beginning of a line to enter a comment in the macro. In addition,   is used to identify certain preprocessor commands that can only be used within a macro. There are two possible preprocessor commands:  macro key description - Each macro can be configured with up to 3 keyword/description pairs. The keywords and descriptions are displayed in the GUI pages when the macro is displayed. The syntax for this preprocessor command is as follows:  macro key description $keyword1 description1 $keyword2 description2 $keyword3 description3 A keyword must be prefixed with '$'.  macro keywords - This instruction enables the device to display the keywords as part of the CLI help. It accepts up to 3 keywords. The command creates a CLI help string with the keywords for the macro. The help string will be displayed if help on the macro is requested from the macro and macro global commands. The GUI also uses the keywords specified in the command as the parameter names for the macro. See Example 2 and 3 below for a description of how this command is used in the CLI. The syntax for this preprocessor command is as follows:  macro keywords $keyword1 $keyword2 $keyword3 where $keywordn is the name of the keyword. Editing a Macro Macros cannot be edited. Modify a macro by creating a new macro with the same name as the existing macro. The newer macro overwrites the existing macro. The exceptions to this are the built-in macros and corresponding anti-macros for the Smartport feature. You cannot override a Smartport macro. Scope of Macro It is important to consider the scope of any user-defined macro. Because of the potential hazards of applying unintended configurations, do not change configuration modes within the macro by using commands such as exit, end, or interface interface-id. With a few exceptions, there are other ways of executing macros in the various configuration modes. Macros may be executed in Privileged Exec mode, Global Configuration mode, and Interface Configuration mode (when the interface is NOT a VLAN.) Examples Example 1 -The following example shows how to create a macro that configures the duplex mode of a port. switchxxxxxx(config)  macro name dup Enter macro commands one per line. End with the character \u2018@\u2019.  macro description dup duplex full negotiation @ Example 2 -The following example shows how to create a macro with the parameters: DUPLEX and SPEED. When the macro is run, the values of DUPLEX and SPEED must be provided by the user. The  macro keywords command enables the user to receive help for the macro as shown in Example 3. switchxxxxxx(config)  macro name duplex Enter macro commands one per line. End with the character \u2018@\u2019. duplex $DUPLEX no negotiation speed $SPEED  macro keywords $DUPLEX $SPEED @ Example 3 -The following example shows how to display the keywords using the help character ? (as defined by the  macro keywords command above) and then run the macro on the port. The  macro keywords command entered in the macro definition enables the user to receive help for the macro, as shown after the words e.g. below. switchxxxxxx(config)  interface gi1/0/1 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  macro apply duplex ? WORD <1-32> Keyword to replace with value e.g. $DUPLEX, $SPEED <cr> switchxxxxxx(config-if)  macro apply duplex $DUPLEX ? WORD<1-32> First parameter value <cr> switchxxxxxx(config-if)  macro apply duplex $DUPLEX full $SPEED ? WORD<1-32> Second parameter value switchxxxxxx(config-if)  macro apply duplex $DUPLEX full $SPEED 100",

Default Configuration The command has no default setting. Command Mode Interface (Ethernet, Port Channel) Configuration mode User Guidelines The macro apply command hides the commands of the macro from the user while it is being run. The macro trace command displays the commands along with any errors which are generated by them as they are executed. This is used to debug the macro and find syntax or configuration errors. When you run a macro, if a line in it fails because of a syntax or configuration error, the macro continues to apply the remaining commands to the interface. If you apply a macro that contains parameters in its commands, the command fails if you do not provide the values for the parameters. You can use the macro apply macro-name with a '?' to display the help string for the macro keywords (if you have defined these with the  macro keywords preprocessor command). Parameter (keyword) matching is case sensitive. All matching occurrences of the parameter are replaced with the provided value. Any full match of a keyword, even if it is part of a large string, is considered a match and replaced by the corresponding value. When you apply a macro to an interface, the switch automatically generates a macro description command with the macro name. As a result, the macro name is appended to the macro history of the interface. The show parser macro command displays the macro history of an interface. A macro applied to an interface range behaves the same way as a macro applied to a single interface. When a macro is applied to an interface range, it is applied sequentially to each interface within the range. If a macro command fails on one interface, it is nonetheless attempted to be applied and may fail or succeed on the remaining interfaces.

Default Configuration Enabled Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines Use the no form of the ipv6 mld snooping vlan querier election command to disable MLD Querier election mechanism on a VLAN. If the MLD Querier election mechanism is enabled, the MLD Snooping querier supports the standard MLD Querier election mechanism specified in RFC2710 and RFC3810. If MLD Querier election mechanism is disabled, MLD Snooping Querier delays sending General Query messages for 60 seconds from the time it was enabled. During this time, if the switch did not receive an IGMP query from another Querier - it starts sending General Query messages. Once the switch acts as a Querier, it will stop sending General Query messages if it detects another Querier on the VLAN. In this case, the switch will resume sending General Query messages if it does hear another Querier for Query Passive interval that equals to <Robustness>*<Query Interval> + 0.5*<Query Response Interval). It is recommended to disable MLD Querier election mechanism if there is an IPMv6 Multicast router on the VLAN.

Default Configuration No group entry exists. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User GuidelinesFor SNMP v1 and v2, this command performs the same actions as snmp-server community-group, except that snmp-server community-group configures both v1 and v2 at the same time. With this command, you must perform it once for v1 and once for v2. A local SNMP EngineID must be defined in order to add SNMPv3 users to the device. For remote hosts users a remote SNMP EngineID is also required. Changing or removing the value of snmpEngineID deletes the SNMPv3 users\u2019 database. The logical key of the command is username. Configuring a remote host is required in order to send informs to that host, because an inform is a trap that requires acknowledgment. A configured remote host is also able to manage the device (besides getting the informs). To configure a remote user, specify the IP address for the remote SNMP agent of the device where the user resides. Also, before you configure remote users for a particular agent, configure the SNMP engine ID, using the snmp-server engineID remote command. The remote agent's SNMP engine ID is needed when computing the authentication and privacy digests from the password. If the remote engine ID is not configured first, the configuration command fails. Since the same group may be defined several times, each time with different version or different access level (noauth, auth or auth & priv), when defining a user it is not sufficient to specify the group name, rather you must specify group name, version and access level for complete determination of how to handle packets from this user. Example This example assigns user tom to group abcd using SNMP v1 and v2c. . User jerry is assigned to group efgh using SNMP v3. switchxxxxxx(config)  snmp-server user tom acbd v1 switchxxxxxx(config)  snmp-server user tom acbd v2c switchxxxxxx(config)  snmp-server user jerry efgh v3 auth sha pass1234",

Only a single match criteria in this class map must be matched. Default Configuration No class map. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines The class-map command and its subcommands are used to define packet classification, marking, and aggregate policing as part of a globally-named service policy applied on a per-interface basis. A class map consists of one or more ACLs. It defines a traffic flow by determining which packets match some or all of the criteria specified in the ACLs. All class map commands are only available when QoS is in advanced mode. The class-map enters Class-map Configuration mode. In this mode, up to two match commands can be entered to configure the criteria for this class. Each match specifies an ACL. When using a few match commands, each must point to a different type of ACL, such as: one IP ACL, one IPv6 ACL, and one MAC ACL. The classification is by first match, therefore, the order of the ACLs is important. Error messages are generated in the following cases: There is more than one match command in a match-all class map There is a repetitive classification field in the participating ACLs. After entering the Class-map Configuration mode, the following configuration commands are available: exit: Exits the Class-map Configuration mode. match: Configures classification criteria. no: Removes a match statement from a class map. Example The following example creates a class map called Class1 and configures it to check that packets match all classification criteria in the ACL specified. switchxxxxxx(config)  class-map class1 match-all switchxxxxxx(config-cmap)  match access-group acl-name",

DSCP remarking will have effect only if the mode is trust dscp. Default Configuration No aggregate policer is defined. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines This command is only available when QoS is in advanced mode. Use the qos aggregate-policer command to define a policer that aggregates traffic from multiple class maps. Aggregate policers cannot aggregate traffic from multiple devices. If the aggregate policer is applied to more than one device, the traffic on each device is counted separately and is limited per device. Traffic from two different ports on the same device can be aggregated for policing purposes. An aggregate policer can be applied to multiple classes in the same policy map. An aggregate policer cannot be deleted if it is being used in a policy map. The no police aggregate Policy-map Class Configuration mode command must first be used to delete the aggregate policer from all policy maps before using the no qos aggregate-policer command. Policing uses a token bucket algorithm. CIR represents the speed with which the token is added to the bucket. CBS represents the depth of the bucket. Examples Example 1. The following example defines the parameters of a policer called policer1 that can be applied to multiple classes in the same policy map. When the average traffic rate exceeds 124,000 kbps or the normal burst size exceeds 9600 bytes, the packet is dropped. switchxxxxxx(config)  qos aggregate-policer policer1 124000 9600 exceed-action dropExample 2.

If two QoS domains have different DSCP definitions, use the DSCP-to-DSCP-mutation map to translate a set of DSCP values to match the definition of another domain. Apply the map to ingress and to DSCP-trusted ports only. Applying this map to a port causes IP packets to be rewritten with newly mapped DSCP values at the ingress ports. If applying the DSCP mutation map to an untrusted port, to class of service (CoS), or to an IP-precedence trusted port. Global trust mode must be DSCP or CoS-DSCP.

Use the right-to-left keyword to specify that the username string should be terminated the string at the first delimiter going from right to left. Examples Example 1: In this example the $ character is configured as a delimiter, and stripping is performed to the left of the delimiter. In this case, if the session user-name is user1$my_users then the username to be matched in the PoD or CoA Request is \u201cuser1\u201d: Switch010203(config)  aaa server radius dynamic-author Switch010203(config-locsvr-da-radius)  domain delimiter $ Switch010203(config-locsvr-da-radius)  domain stripping Example 2: In this example stripping is performed up to the 1st delimiter to the left of the first delimiter going from right to left, using the default delimiter of @. In this case, if the session user-name is user1@test.com@example.com then the username to be matched in the PoD or CoA Request is \u201cuser1@test.com\u201d: Switch010203(config)  aaa server radius dynamic-author Switch010203(config-locsvr-da-radius)  domain stripping right-to-left",

Examples Example 1.The following example shows how to enable RIP on IP interface 1.1.1.1 with the default interface configuration: switchxxxxxx(config)  router rip switchxxxxxx(config-rip)  network 1.1.1.1 switchxxxxxx(config-rip)  exit Example 2. The following example enables RIP on 1.1.1.1 in the shutdown state, configures metric and starts RIP:switchxxxxxx(config)  router rip switchxxxxxx(config-rip)  network 1.1.1.1 shutdown switchxxxxxx(config-rip)  exit switchxxxxxx(config)  interface ip 1.1.1.1 switchxxxxxx(config-route-map)  ip rip offset 2 switchxxxxxx(config-route-map)  no ip rip shutdown switchxxxxxx(config-route-map)  exit",

    "page_content": "To redistribute routes from one routing domain into a RIP routing domain, use the redistribute command in the Router RIP configuration mode. To disable redistribution, use the no form of this command. Syntax redistribute protocol [metric {metric-value | transparent}] no redistribute protocol Parameters protocol\u2014Source protocol from which routes are being redistributed. It can be one of the following keywords: connected or static. metric transparent\u2014Causes RIP to use the source protocol metric for redistributed routes as the RIP metric. Only routes with metric less than 16 are redistributed. metric metric-value\u2014Specifies the metric assigned to the redistributed routes. The value supersedes the metric value specified using the default-metric command. Default Configuration Route redistribution is disabled Command Mode Router RIP Configuration mode User Guidelines Routes distributed to the source protocol are never redistributed by it The connected keyword is used to redistribute to RIP routes that correspond to defined IP interfaces on which RIP is not enabled. By default, the RIP Routing Table includes only routes that correspond only to IP interfaces on which it is enabled. The static keyword is used to redistribute to RIP static routes. By default, static routes are not redistributed to RIP. If the metric value is set by the route map (by the set metric command) then the value will supersede the metric value specified by the metric-value argument. If the metric keyword is not defined, then the metric is specified by the default-metric CLI command is assigned to the redistributed routes. If metric value set by the route map is equal or bigger than 16 the route is not redistributed. Changing or disabling any keyword will not affect the state of other keywords. Removing options that you have configured for the redistribute command requires careful use of the no form of the redistribute command to ensure that you obtain the result that you are expecting. Examples Example 1.The following example enables redistribution of static routes by RIP with transparent metric: switchxxxxxx(config)  router rip switchxxxxxx(config-rip)  redistribute static metric transparent switchxxxxxx(config-rip)  exit Example 2. The following example enables redistribution of static routes by RIP with transparent metric and then changes the metric to default: switchxxxxxx(config)  router rip switchxxxxxx(config-rip)  redistribute static metric transparent switchxxxxxx(config-rip)  no redistribute static metric transparent switchxxxxxx(config-rip)  exit Example 3. The following example enables redistribution of static routes by RIP with default metric and then changes the metric to transparent: switchxxxxxx(config)  router rip switchxxxxxx(config-rip)  redistribute static switchxxxxxx(config-rip)  redistribute static metric transparent switchxxxxxx(config-rip)  exit Example 4. The following example enables redistribution of static routes by RIP with transparent metric. The second redistribute command does not affect: switchxxxxxx(config)  router rip switchxxxxxx(config-rip)  redistribute static metric transparent switchxxxxxx(config-rip)  redistribute static switchxxxxxx(config-rip)  exit Example 5.

Command Mode Privileged EXEC mode User Guidelines Hardware based routing is supported automatically on device once IPv4 or IPv6 route is enabled. However, hardware based routing is de-activated automatically by the software in cases where device hardware resources cannot support the amount of IPv4 and/or IPv6 entries. IPv4 entries - IPv4 interfaces/addresses and routes and as well as IPv4 Multicast entries; IPv6 entries - IPv6 interfaces/addresses and routes as well as IPv6 Multicast entries; Once Hardware based routing is de-activated by the system the user needs to apply the set router hardware-routing active command to re-activate hardware based routing on device. It is recommended to adjust the number of IPv4 and/or IPv6 entries on device to match the device hardware capabilities Once command is applied, the device begins to update all existing IP entries to device hardware tables. If process succeeds - hardware based routing will be re-activated. If process fails (for example device hardware resource are still not sufficient to support current device IP entries), hardware routing status will remain in-active. Syslog messages will indicate to user the start of the hardware table update process and the success or failure of such update. Examples Example 1.

If the new max-number parameter is lower than the actual number of entries currently in-use settings, a confirmation message is displayed to the user (before the save confirmation message). Use the no system resources command to restore the default settings. Examples Example 1 - The following example defines the supported number of entries for IPv4 policy based routes,IPv6 policy based routes and/or VLAN mapping. switchxxxxxx(config)  system resources policy-ip-routes 20 policy-ipv6-routes 32 vlan-mapping-entries 100 In-Use Reserved (Current) Reserved (New) - - - IPv4 policy Routes 8 16 20 IPv6 policy Routes 8 16 32 VLAN Mapping Entries 32 32 100 Setting the new configuration of entries requires saving the running-configuration file to startup-configuration file and rebooting the system, do you want to continue? (Y/N) [N] Y Example 2 - In the following example, the configured entries are less than the entries which are currently in use by the device. Using this configurations means that the system may not have enough resources for the running again in the existing network: switchxxxxxx(config)  system resources policy-ip-routes 8 policy-ipv6-routes 8 vlan-mapping-routes 16 In-Use Reserved (Current) Reserved (New) - - - IPv4 policy Routes 10 20 8 IPv6 policy Routes 10 32 8 VLAN Mapping Entries 50 100 16 1) In one or more of the parameters, the new max entry configuration is less than the entries which are currently in use by the system, do you want to continue? 2) Setting the new configuration of entries requires saving the running-configuration file to startup-configuration file and rebooting the system. Do you want to continue? Do you want to continue? (Y/N) [N] Y",

    "page_content": "To define the conditions for policy routing, use the route-map command in Global Configuration mode and the match and set commands in Route Map Configuration Mode. To delete an entry, use the no form of this command. Syntax route-map map-tag [sequence-number] no route-map map-tag [sequence-number] Parameters map-tag\u2014A meaningful name for the route map. The redistribute router configuration command uses this name to reference this route map. Multiple route maps may share the same map tag name. sequence-number\u2014Positive integer number that indicates the position a new route map will have in the list of route maps already configured with the same name. If the parameter is used with the no form of this command, the position of the route map should be deleted. If the parameter is omitted in the route-map command then a value of 10 is applied. If the parameter is omitted in the no format then all route maps sharing same map tag name are deleted. Default Configuration Conditions for policy routing is not configured. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines Use the route-map command to enter route-map configuration mode. The purpose of the route map command is to define policy routing. The match commands specify the conditions under which policy routing occurs and the set commands specify the routing actions to perform if the criteria enforced by the match commands are met: If a outed packet matches to an ACL with the permit action the packet is forwarded by the set command (policy based routing). If a outed packet matches to an ACL with the deny action the frame is forwarded by the Forwarding table (regular routing). A route map can have several sections configured by separate route-map commands with the same map tag. When a routed packet is checked by a route map the first section which criteria is forced is applied. If there is no matched section the obvious shortest path using the Forwarding Table is applied. Examples Example 1. The following example gives an example of a route map with one section. TCP packet sent to subnet 156.12.5.0/24 are passed to the next hop 56.1.1.1. switchxxxxxx(config)  ip access-list extended pr-acl1 switchxxxxxx(config-ip-al)  permit tcp any any 156.12.5.0 0.0.0.255 any switchxxxxxx(config-ip-al)  exit switchxxxxxx(config)  route-map pbr switchxxxxxx(config-route-map)  match ip address access-list pr-acl1 switchxxxxxx(config-route-map)  set ip next-hop 56.1.1.1 switchxxxxxx(config-route-map)  exit switchxxxxxx(config)  interface vlan 1 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  ip policy route-map pbr switchxxxxxx(config-if)  exit Example 2. The following example gives an example of a route map with two sections. TCP packet sent to subnet 156.12.5.0/24 are passed to the next hop 56.1.1.1 and CP packet sent to subnet 156.122.5.0/24 are passed to the next hop 50.1.1.1. switchxxxxxx(config)  ip access-list extended pr-acl1 switchxxxxxx(config-ip-al)  permit tcp any any 156.12.5.0 0.0.0.255 any switchxxxxxx(config-ip-al)  exit switchxxxxxx(config)  ip access-list extended pr-acl2 switchxxxxxx(config-ip-al)  permit tcp any any 156.122.5.0 0.0.0.255 any switchxxxxxx(config-ip-al)  exit switchxxxxxx(config)  route-map pbr 10 switchxxxxxx(config-route-map)  match ip address access-list pr-acl1 switchxxxxxx(config-route-map)  set ip next-hop 56.1.1.1 switchxxxxxx(config-route-map)  exit switchxxxxxx(config)  route-map pbr 20 switchxxxxxx(config-route-map)  match ip address access-list pr-acl2 switchxxxxxx(config-route-map)  set ip next-hop 50.1.1.1 switchxxxxxx(config-route-map)  exit switchxxxxxx(config)  interface vlan 1 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  ip policy route-map pbr switchxxxxxx(config-if)  exit",

Command Mode Privileged EXEC mode User Guidelines Use this command to export a certificate request to a Certification Authority. The certificate request is generated in Base64-encoded X.509 format. Before generating a certificate request, first generate a self-signed certificate using the crypto cerificate generate command to generate the keys. The certificate fields must be re-entered. After receiving the certificate from the Certification Authority, use the crypto cerificate import command to import the certificate into the device. This certificate replaces the self-signed certificate.

Default Configuration Administrative state is Disabled Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines Regardless of the status of Auto Smartport, you can always manually apply a Smartport macro to its associated Smartport type. A Smartport macro is either a built-in macro or a user-defined macro. You can define and apply a macro using the CLI commands presented in the Macro Commands section. If the Auto Smartport Administrative state is controlled, the Auto Smartport Operational state is managed by the Voice VLAN manager and is set as follows: Auto Smartport Operational state is disabled when the OUI Voice VLAN is enabled. Auto Smartport Operational state is enabled when the Auto Voice VLAN is enabled. A user cannot enable Auto Smartport globally if the OUI Voice VLAN is enabled. Example This example shows an attempt to enable the Auto Smartport feature globally in the controlled mode. This is not possible because the OUI voice feature is enabled. The voice VLAN state is then disabled, after which Auto Smartports can be enabled. The appropriate VLANs are automatically enabled because the ports are configured for Auto Smartports on these VLANs. switchxxxxxx(config)  macro auto controlled switchxxxxxx(config)  macro auto enabled Auto smartports cannot be enabled because OUI voice is enabled. switchxxxxxx(config)  voice vlan state disabled switchxxxxxx(config)  macro auto enabled switchxxxxxx(config)  10-Apr-2011 16:11:31 %LINK-I-Up: Vlan 20 10-Apr-2011 16:11:33 %LINK-I-Up: Vlan 5 10-Apr-2011 16:11:33 %LINK-I-Up: Vlan 6 10-Apr-2011 16:11:33 %LINK-I-Up: Vlan 7 10-Apr-2011 16:11:33 %LINK-I-Up: Vlan 8 10-Apr-2011 16:11:33 %LINK-I-Up: Vlan 9 10-Apr-2011 16:11:33 %LINK-I-Up: Vlan 10",

Each monitor session source command defines one source port or VLAN. Different monitor session source commands must define different sources. A new command with the same session number and the same source overrides the previous defined one. Up to 8 sources can be defined in one session.

To return to default, use the no form of this command. Syntax remote-span no remote-span Parameters This command has no arguments or keywords. Default Configuration A VLAN is not a RSPAN remote VLAN. Command Mode VLAN Configuration mode User Guidelines Use the remote-span command to define a VLAN as a RSPAN remote VLAN. Only one Remote VLAN can be defined per switch. The Remote VLAN must be created manually before configuring of the remote-span command. Guest VLAN cannot be configured as a Remote VLAN. All traffic into a RSPLAN VLAN is tagged and MAC learning is disabled in a RSPAN VLAN. The remote-span command verifies that all ports of the configured VLAN are egress tagged ports and disables MAC learning. The no remote-span command resets MAC learning. Note. The membership of a RSPAN remote VLAN depended where it is defined: Source or Start switch\u2014It is recommended that the RSPAN remote VLAN does not have any memberships. Intermediate switch\u2014It is recommended to remove the RSPAN remote VLAN from trunk ports not used for passing mirrored traffic to avoid superfluous flooding. Usually, a RSPAN remote VLAN contains two ports. Destination or Final switch\u2014The RSPAN remote VLAN should contain memberships on which the mirrored traffic via this VLAN is arrived.

If the switch-number is specified, the environment status of the selected device number is displayed. (Range: 1 \u2013 4) Command Mode User EXEC mode User Guidelines The fan and temperature status parameters are available only on devices on which fan and/or temperature sensor are installed. Fan status can be one of: OK - The fan/s functions correctly. Failure - One or more of the fans failed. Fan read fail - Reading information from one or more fans failed. NA - No fan is installed. Temperature can be one of: OK - The temperature is below the warning threshold. Warning- The temperature is between the warning threshold and the critical threshold. Critical - the temperature is above the critical threshold. Sensor status can be one of: OK - All Sensors on device are functioning properly. Failure - One or more of the sensors failed. NA - No sensor installed. Examples Example 1 - The following example displays the general environment status of a device or a stack. switchxxxxxx> show environment all Internal power supply Active.fans OK Sensor is OK Temperature is OK  EDITOR: The temperature status is OK if ALL the temperature sensors status in all the stack members is OK, and if the temperature of all the stack members is below the lowest threshold (this is calculated per stack member, if one or more of the stack members temperature is above its specific threshold, the temperature status is FAILURE)  EDITOR: Likewise the fan status will be OK - only if status of fans on ALL stack members is OK (meaning no fan fail - or with redundant fan support - only 1 fan fail and redundant fan active Example 2 - The following example displays the power status of a device or a stack. switchxxxxxx> show environment power Internal power supply Active. Example 3 - The following example displays the general fan status of a device or a stack. switchxxxxxx> show environment fan fans OK  EDITOR: The fan status is OK if the fan sensors status in ALL the stack members is OK Example 4 - The following example displays the temperature status of a device or a stack. switchxxxxxx> show environment temperature status TEMPERATURE level is Warning Example 5 - The following example displays the detailed environment status of a stack. switchxxxxxx> show environment stack Unit fan Status - - 1 OK 2 Failure 3 Read fan fail 4 NA  EDITOR: * fan Direction column will be printed only in SKUs which support this feature, or in a stack when one of the units might support this feature.

Syntax show platform {sudi | attestation} certificate [sign [nonce <nonce value>] Parameters {sudi | attestation} - display either SUDI or Attestation (AIK - Attestation Identity Key) certificate. sign\u2014(Optional) display a signature over the certificate [nonce <nonce value>]\u2014(Optional) provide a nonce to use with the signature to protect from replay attacks. (range 0-4,294,967,295) Default Usage The certificate is displayed without a signature. If the sign parameter is specified without a nonce value then the signature will be generated without using a nonce. Command Mode Privileged EXEC mode User Guidelines The show platform certificate command displays the device SUDI or AIK (Attestation Identity Key) certificate. The command output includes the certificate chain in PEM format, where the first certificate that is displayed is the Cisco Root CA, and the second certificate that is displayed is the Cisco published on https:/www.cisco.com/security/pki/. The third certificate is the SUDI or AIK leaf certificate. If the optional sign parameter is used, then the command output will display a signature over the certificates using either the SUDI (if sudi keyword is used) or AIK (if attestation keyword is used) private key. The command also supports an optional [nonce <nonce value>] parameter used as part of the signature inputs to prevent replay attacks. If the [nonce <nonce value>] parameter is not provided the signed data will not include the nonce. The command output includes a signature version. Signature value of 1 indicates that the SUDI private key was used for signing, while a signature value of 2 indicates that the AIK private key was used for signing. Examples Example 1: The following example displays the SUDI certificate chain without a signature: switchxxxxxx> show platform sudi certificate -BEGIN CERTIFICATE-

If the attestation keyword is not specified then the SUDI private key will be used to sign the PCR. Command Mode Privileged EXEC mode User Guidelines The show platform hardware integrity command provides on demand chip protection attestation. The command displays the content of the Active unit PCR (Platform Configuration Register) 15. PCR-15 is the extension of the device unique chip IDs. If the sign keyword is used, then the command output will display a signature over PCR-15. If the attestation keyword is used then the command output will include also a PCR Quote and the signature will be over the quote. The command also supports an optional [nonce <nonce value>] parameter used as part of the signature inputs to prevent replay attacks. If the [nonce <nonce value>] parameter is not provided the signed data will not include the nonce. The command output includes a signature version. A signature value of 1 indicates that the SUDI private key was used for signing PCR-15. A signature value of 2 indicates that the attestation (AIK) private key was used for signing the PCR Quote.

Command Mode Interface Configuration mode User Guidelines The ASV feature can only be enabled on interfaces whose Switchport Mode is Access or General. Access mode should be used for interfaces who will be connected to a single surveillance device. General mode should be used to interfaces connected to other network nodes that may be then connected to multiple surveillance devices. If traffic from a source defined as a surveillance source is detected on an interface with the ASV feature enabled, the interface becomes a member in the surveillance VLAN. The VLAN priority tag of the surveillance traffic forwarded on this interface will be set to the CoS value defined in the surveillance-vlan cos command.

In access mode, when an interface is added to the surveillance VLAN, it is removed from its original membership while it is a member of the surveillance-VLAN. In general mode, the surveillance traffic will be routed on the surveillance VLAN while non-surveillance traffic will use the original VLAN membership of the interface.

If the user name is not in the local user database, then the user receives a warning message, and the user will need to pass the device management AAA authentication independently of the SSH authentication. If the auto-login keyword is not specified, management access is granted only if the user engages and passes both SSH authentication and device management AAA authentication independently.If no SSH authentication method is enabled management access is granted only if the user is AAA authenticated by the device management. No SSH authentication method means SSH is enabled and neither SSH authentication by public key nor password is enabled. Example The following example enables authentication of the SSH client.switchxxxxxx(config)  ip ssh pubkey-auth",

In the aggressive mode the device shuts down a port if it cannot explicitly detect that the link is bidirectional. In the normal mode the device shuts down an interface if it explicitly detect that the link is unidirectional. A unidirectional link occurs whenever traffic sent by a local device is received by its neighbor but traffic from the neighbor is not received by the local device. You can use the following commands to reset an interface shut down by UDLD: The errdisable recover reset command with the interface interface-id parameter to reset a given interface. The errdisable recover reset command with the udld parameter to reset all interfaces shut down by UDLD.

Command Mode Interface (Ethernet, Port Channel) Configuration mode User Guidelines When the port\u2019s mode is changed, it receives the configuration corresponding to the mode. If the port mode is changed to access and the access VLAN does not exist, then the port does not belong to any VLAN.Use the switchport mode vlan-mapping {tunnel | one-to-one} command to configure a VLAN mapping mode of an edge interface of a Provider Edge switch. The edge interface is an interface where a Customer network is connected to the Provider Edge switch. The network which the switch belongs to is a Provider network. These networks (Customer ones and Provider one) can use the same VLAN-IDs and the edge interface must perform vlan mapping between Customer VLANs (C-VLANs) and Provider VLANs (S-VLANs).On an edge interface C-VLANs are mapped to S-VLANs and the original C-VLAN tags are kept as part of payload. When a frame is sent on non-edge tagged interface, it is encapsulated with another layer of S-VLAN tag to which the original C-VLAN-ID is mapped. Therefore, transmitted on non-edge interfaces frames are double-tagged, with the outer S-VLAN tag and inner C-VLAN tag. When a frame is sent on an edge interface the S-VLAN tag is stripped.On an edge interface C-VLANs are mapped to the S-VLANs and the original C-VLAN-ID in input frame is replaced by the S-VLAN ID to which it is mapped. Untagged frames are dropped. Symmetrical translating back to the edge interface.The following features cannot be enabled if vlan-mapping is allowed: IPv4 routing IPv6 routing Auto Smart Port Voice VLAN The switchport vlan-mapping commands cannot add a port to a S-VLAN. IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces cannot be defined on VLANs containing edge interfaces. The following Layer 2 features are not supported into VLANs containing edge interfaces: IGMP Snooping MLD Snooping DHCP Snooping IPv6 First Hop Security The following protocols cannot be enabled on edge interfaces: STP GVRP The following features are not supported on edge interfaces: Radius VLAN assignment 802.1x Guest VLAN Egress ACLs are not supported on one-to-one VLAN mapping edge ports. A destination port with the network keyword or reflector port cannot be configured on an edge port. Note. All the limitations for edge ports specified above are checked by the switchport vlan-mapping commands and by the commands configuring these features. By default the switch does not forward frames received on edge ports with the following destination MAC addresses: 01:80:C2:00:00:00-01:80:C2:00:00:FF 01:00:0C:00:00:00-01:00:0C:FF:FF:FF 01:00:0C:CD:CD:D0 Note.

Default Configuration The Layer 2 frames are not forwarded. Command Mode Interface (Ethernet, Port Channel) Configuration mode User Guidelines By default, the switch drops on edge ports input L2 PDUs with the following destination MAC addresses: 01:80:C2:00:00:00-01:80:C2:00:00:FF - with the exception of LACP frame (destination MAC 01:80:C2:00:00:02) which is processed by the edge port 01:00:0C:00:00:00-01:00:0C:FF:FF:FF 01:00:0C:CD:CD:D0 Use the switchport vlan-mapping tunnel l2protocol forward command to enable forward over the Provider network untagged frames of a given Layer 2 protocol received on a vlan-mapping tunnel interface. The received tagged Layer 2 frames are discarded. When a L2 protocol is forwarded the switch overwrites the customer destination MAC address with a \u2019well-known\u2019 Multicast address 01:00:0C:CD:CD:D0 before transmission the frame on non-edge port. When a frame with the destination address equals to this well-known Multicast address is received on non-edge port the switch forwards it to all non-edge ports belonging to the S_VLAN and to all edge ports belonging to the S-VLAN and configured with the forward option for the given protocol. The switch replaces the 'well-known\u2019 destination MAC address with the respective Layer 2 protocol MAC address he respective Layer 2 protocol MAC address. CDP cannot be both enabled and also tunneled on the same interfaces. To enable CDP tunneling on a Port Channel interface, CDP first needs to be disabled on all the members of the Port Channel (active and in-active). Likewise, an Ethernet Interface with CDP enabled cannot be added to a Port Channel on which CDP tunneling is enabled. LLDP cannot be both enabled and also tunneled on the same interfaces. To enable LLDP tunneling on a Port Channel interface, LLDP first needs to be disabled on all the members of the Port Channel (active and in-active). Likewise, an Ethernet Interface with CDP enabled cannot be added to a Port Channel on which CDP tunneling is enabled.

Syntax voice vlan state {auto-enabled | auto-triggeredoui-enabled | disabled} no voice vlan state Parameters auto-enabled\u2014Auto Voice VLAN is enabled. auto-triggered\u2014Auto Voice VLAN on the switch is in standby and is put into operation when the switch detects a CDP device advertising a voice VLAN or if a voice VLAN ID is configured manually on the switch. oui-enabled\u2014Voice VLAN is of type OUI. disabled\u2014Voice VLAN is disabled. Default Configuration Disabled Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines By factory default, CDP, LLDP, and LLDP-MED are enabled on the switch. In addition, manual Smartport mode and Basic QoS with trusted DSCP is enabled. All ports are members of default VLAN 1, which is also the default Voice VLAN. If the state is set to dynamic voice VLAN (auto-triggered) mode then voice VLAN is enabled by a trigger (advertisement received by voice device attached to port). If the administrative state is: disabled \u2014 The operational state is disabled. oui-enabled \u2014The operational state is oui-enabled. auto-enabled \u2014 The operational state is auto-enabled. auto-triggered \u2014 The operational state is auto-enabled only if one of the following occurs: A static local configured voice VLAN ID, CoS/802.1p, and/or DSCP that is not factory default is configured. A CDP voice VLAN advertisement is received from a neighboring CDP device that is not a a device of the same family as the current device. A Voice Service Discovery Protocol (VSDP) message was received from a neighbor switch. VSDP is a Cisco Small Business proprietary protocol for SF and SG series managed switches. In all other cases the operational state is disabled. Notes: To change the administrative state from oui-enabled to auto-enabled (or auto-triggered), or vice versa, you must first set the administrative state to disabled. The administrative state cannot be set to oui-enabled if the Auto SmartPort administrative state is enabled. The administrative state cannot be set to oui-enabled if the voice VLAN is the default VLAN (VLAN 1). For oui-enabled mode, the voice VLAN cannot be 1.
