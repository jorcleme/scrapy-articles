Users at this level can\u2019t access the web GUI or commands in the Privileged EXEC mode. Level 7\u2014Users with this level can run commands in the User EXEC mode and a subset of commands in the Privileged EXEC mode. Users at this level can\u2019t access the web GUI. Level 15\u2014Users with this level can run all commands. Only users at this level can access the web GUI. A system administrator (user with level 15) can create passwords that allow a lower-level user to temporarily become a higher-level user. For example, the user may go from level 1 to level 7, level 1 to 15, or level 7 to level 15. The passwords for each level are set (by an administrator) using the following command: enable password [level privilege-level]{password|encrypted encrypted-password} Using these passwords, you can raise your user level by entering the command: enable and the password for level 7 or 15. You can go from level 1 to level 7 or directly to level 15. The higher level holds only for the current session. The disable command returns the user to a lower level. To create a user and assign it a user level, use the username command. Only users with command level 15 can create users at this level.

    "page_content": "The CLI is divided into four command modes. The command modes are (in the order in which they are accessed): User EXEC mode Privileged EXEC mode Global Configuration mode Each command mode has its own unique console prompt and set of CLI commands. Entering a question mark at the console prompt displays a list of available commands for the current mode and for the level of the user. Specific commands are used to switch from one mode to another. Users are assigned privilege levels that determine the modes and commands available to them. User EXEC Mode Users with level 1 initially log into User EXEC mode. User EXEC mode is used for tasks that do not change the configuration, such as performing basic tests and listing system information. The user-level prompt consists of the switch host name followed by a  . The default host name is switchxxxxxx where xxxxxx is the last six digits of the device\u2019s MAC address, as shown below switchxxxxxx  The default host name can be changed via the hostname command in Global Configuration mode. Privileged EXEC Mode A user with level 7 or 15 automatically logs into Privileged EXEC mode. Users with level 1 can enter Privileged Exec mode by entering the enable command, and when prompted, the password for level 15. To return from the Privileged EXEC mode to the User EXEC mode, use the disable command Global Configuration Mode The Global Configuration mode is used to run commands that configure features at the system level, as opposed to the interface level. Only users with command level of 7 or 15 can access this mode. To access Global Configuration mode from Privileged EXEC mode, enter the configure command at the Privileged EXEC mode prompt and press Enter. The Global Configuration mode prompt, consisting of the device host name followed by (config) , is displayed: switchxxxxxx(config)  Use any of the following commands to return from Global Configuration mode to the Privileged EXEC mode: exit end Ctrl+Z The following example shows how to access Global Configuration mode and return to Privileged EXEC mode: switchxxxxxx  switchxxxxxx  configure switchxxxxxx(config)  exit switchxxxxxx  Interface or Line Configuration Modes Various submodes may be entered from Global Configuration mode. These submodes enable performing commands on a group of interfaces or lines. For instance to perform several operations on a specific port or range of ports, you can enter the Interface Configuration mode for that interface. The following example enters Interface Configuration mode for vlan1 and then sets their speed: The exit command returns to Global Configuration mode. switchxxxxxx  switchxxxxxx  configure switchxxxxxx(config)  interface range vlan1 switchxxxxxx(config-if) speed 10 switchxxxxxx(config-if) exit switchxxxxxx(config)  The following is a sample of some of the available submodes: Interface\u2014Contains commands that configure a specific interface (port, VLAN, port channel, or tunnel) or range of interfaces. The Global Configuration mode command interface is used to enter the Interface Configuration mode. The interface Global Configuration command is used to enter this mode. Line Interface\u2014Contains commands used to configure the management connections for the console, Telnet and SSH. These include commands such as line timeout settings, etc. The line Global Configuration command is used to enter the Line Configuration command mode. VLAN Database\u2014Contains commands used to configure a VLAN as a whole. The vlan database Global Configuration mode command is used to enter the VLAN Database Interface Configuration mode. Management Access List\u2014Contains commands used to define management access-lists. The management access-list Global Configuration mode command is used to enter the Management Access List Configuration mode. MAC Access-List, IPv6 Access List, IP Access List\u2014Configures conditions required to allow traffic based on MAC addresses, IPv6 address and IPv4 address, respectively. The mac access-list, ipv6 access-list and ip access-list Global Configuration mode commands are used to enter the these configuration mode. To return from any Interface Configuration mode to the Global Configuration mode, use the exit command.",

The device supports the following debug interfaces: U-BOOT access during boot sequence (access is possible only via serial console terminal) Linux Kernel access during boot sequence (access is possible only via serial console terminal) Run time debug modes - allows Cisco Support Team personnel to view device settings, and to apply protocol and layer 1 debug commands and settings (access is possible via serial, telnet or SSH console terminal) The password for these interfaces is generated as follows: Upon access to debug interface the device generates a random hash value and displays it on the screen. The hash value is sent by the device administrator and the Cisco support person for signing on a secure Cisco server using a private key. The output of this operation is used as the password for debug interface access. The password is good for current session.

Using SSH from an application that supports SSH client running on a computer with a network connection to the switch. Note Telnet and SSH are disabled by default on the switch. If access is via a Telnet or SSH connection, ensure that the following conditions are met before using CLI commands: The switch has a defined IP address Corresponding management access is enabled. There is an IP path such that the computer and the switch can reach each other Using a Terminal over the Console Interface The device supports a dual console management interface - a Type-C USB interface and an RJ45 port. If both Type-C USB and RJ45 are connected the Type-C USB interface has precedence. To support the Type-C interface a driver may need to be installed on the management station. Note The Type-C USB interface will become active a few seconds after the device is turned on/rebooted. After the computer and switch are connected, run a terminal application to access the CLI. The terminal emulator must be configured to databits=8 and parity=none. Click Enter twice, so that the device sets the serial port speed to match the PC's serial port speed. When the CLI appears, enter cisco at the User Name prompt and then enter cisco for the Password prompt. Note If this is the first time that you have logged on with the default username and password, the device will display a prompt to change username and Password.

One option must be selected. For example, flowcontrol {auto|on|off} means that for the flowcontrol command, either auto, on, or off must be selected \" (inverted commas) When the input string contains space and/or reserved words (i.e. VLAN), put the string in inverted commas. parameter Italic text indicates a parameter. press key Names of keys to be pressed are shown in bold. Ctrl+F4 Keys separated by the + character are to be pressed simultaneously on the keyboard Screen Display Fixed-width font indicates CLI prompts, CLI commands entered by the user, and system messages displayed on the console. all When a parameter is required to define a range of ports or parameters and all is an option, the default for the command is all when no parameters are defined. For example, the command interface range port-channel has the option of either entering a range of channels, or selecting all. When the command is entered without a parameter, it automatically defaults to all. text When free text can be entered as a parameter for a command (for example in command: snmp-server contact) if the text consists of multiple words separated by blanks, the entire string must appear in double quotes.

    "page_content": "Entering Commands A CLI command is a series of keywords and arguments. Keywords identify a command, and arguments specify configuration parameters. For example, in the command show interfaces status Gigabitethernet 1, show, interfaces and status are keywords, Gigabitethernet is an argument that specifies the interface type, and1 specifies the port. To enter commands that require parameters, enter the required parameters after the command keyword. For example, to set a password for the administrator, enter: switchxxxxxx(config)  username admin password Alansmith1 When working with the CLI, the command options are not displayed. The standard command to request help is ? There are two instances where help information can be displayed: Keyword lookup\u2014The character ? is entered in place of a command. A list of all valid commands and corresponding help messages are is displayed Partial keyword lookup\u2014If a command is incomplete and or the character ? is entered in place of a parameter, the matched keyword or parameters for this command are displayed. Terminal Command Buffer Every time a command is entered in the CLI, it is recorded on an internally managed Command History buffer. Commands stored in the buffer are maintained on a First In First Out (FIFO) basis. These commands can be recalled, reviewed, modified, and reissued. This buffer is not preserved across device resets. Keyword Description Up-Arrow key Recalls commands in the history buffer, beginning with the most recent command. Repeat the key sequence to recall successively older commands. Down-Arrow key Returns to more recent commands in the history buffer after recalling commands with the up-arrow key. Repeating the key sequence will recall successively more recent commands. By default, the history buffer system is enabled, but it can be disabled at any time. For more information on enabling or disabling the history buffer, refer to the history command. There is a standard default number of commands that are stored in the buffer. The standard number of 10 commands can be increased to 216. By configuring 0, the effect is the same as disabling the history buffer system. For more information on configuring the command history buffer, refer to the history size command. To display the history buffer, refer to the show history command. Negating the Effect of Commands For many configuration commands, the prefix keyword no can be entered to cancel the effect of a command or reset the configuration to the default value. This Reference Guide provides a description of the negation effect for each CLI command. Command Completion If the command entered is incomplete, invalid or has missing or invalid parameters, then the appropriate error message is displayed. This assists in entering the correct command. By pressing Tab after an incomplete command is entered, the system will attempt to identify and complete the command. If the characters already entered are not enough for the system to identify a single matching command, press ? to display the available commands matching the characters already entered. Keyboard Shortcuts The CLI has a range of keyboard shortcuts to assist in editing the CLI commands. The following table describes the CLI shortcuts. Keyboard Key Description Up-arrow Recalls commands from the history buffer, beginning with the most recent command. Repeat the key sequence to recall successively older commands. Down-arrow Returns the most recent commands from the history buffer after recalling commands with the up arrow key. Repeating the key sequence will recall successively more recent commands. Ctrl+A Moves the cursor to the beginning of the command line. Ctrl+E Moves the cursor to the end of the command line. Ctrl+Z / End Returns back to the Privileged EXEC mode from any configuration mode. Backspace Deletes one character left to the cursor position. Copying and Pasting Text Up to 1000 lines of text (or commands) can be copied and pasted into the device. Note It is the user\u2019s responsibility to ensure that the text copied into the device consists of legal commands only. When copying and pasting commands from a configuration file, make sure that the following conditions exist: A device Configuration mode has been accessed. The commands contain no encrypted data, like encrypted passwords or keys. Encrypted data cannot be copied and pasted into the device except for encrypted passwords where the keyword encrypted is used before the encrypted data (for instance in the enable password command).",

    "page_content": "When an IP application on a router wants to communicate with a remote IP application, it must select the local IP address to be used as its IP address. It can use any IP address defined on the router, but if this link goes down, the communication is aborted, even though there might well be another IP route between these IP applications. The loopback interface is a virtual interface whose operational state is always up. If the IP address that is configured on this virtual interface is used as the local address when communicating with remote IP applications, the communication will not be aborted even if the actual route to the remote application was changed. The name of the loopback interface is loopback1. A loopback interface does not support bridging; it cannot be a member of any VLAN, and no layer 2 protocol can be enabled on it. Layer 3 Specification IP Interface IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be assigned to a loopback interface. The IPv6 link-local interface identifier is 1. Routing Protocols A routing protocol running on the switch supports the advertising of the IP prefixes defined on the loopback interfaces via the routing protocol redistribution mechanism. Configuration Examples Static RoutingThe following example shows you how to configure IP on a switch with static routing:Switch  configure terminal Switch(config)  interface vlan 1 Switch(config-if)  ip address 10.10.10.2 /24 Switch(config-if)  ipv6 address 2001:DB8:2222:7270:2312/64 Switch(config-if)  exit Switch(config)  interface vlan 2 Switch(config-if)  ip address 10.11.11.2 /24 Switch(config-if)  ipv6 address 2001:DB8:3333:7271:2312/64 Switch(config-if)  exit Switch(config)  interface loopback 1 Switch(config-if)  ip address 172.25.13.2 /32 Switch(config-if)  ipv6 address 2001:DB8:2222:7272:72/128 Switch(config-if)  exit Switch(config)  ip route 0.0.0.0/0 10.10.11.1 Switch(config)  ip route 10.11.0.0 /16 10.11.11.1 Switch(config)  ipv6 route 0:/0 2001:DB8:2222:7270:1 Switch(config)  ipv6 route 2001:DB8:3333:/48 2001:DB8:3333:7271:1The neighbor router 10.10.11.1 should be configured with the following static route: ip route 172.25.13.2 /32 10.10.10.2.

Fiber cable and Transceivers Cisco brand provides a panoply a SFP modules, while our switches support other 3rd party, it is important to pay attention on the type of fiber cable to use in conjunction with the specific SFP module. Fiber cables can be classified in two types: Single Mode and Multimode. The main difference is the distance they are capable of covering and their diameter. Single Mode fibers cover greater distance compared to Multimode and has lower diameter (around 9 micrometer) while the Multimode fibers diameter is 50-62.5 micrometer. DAC cables for Direct Attach Copper Cable, on the other hand, can be used for short distances. They are mainly based on the Multimode-Standard type of transceivers due to the fact that the max distance they can cover is 15m. The AOC (Active Optical Cable), however, is a different story. When troubleshooting fiber connectivity related issues, it is important to make a distinction between SMF (Single Mode Fiber cables), and MMF (Multimode Fiber cables) and their corresponding SFP transceivers a given fiber can support. Cisco has matrix that we can refer to when trying to make a determination of the correct pairing. The following link provide some insight on Cisco 10gig SFP Example: The Cisco SFP-10G-SR only works with MMF type of cable of 62.5 micrometer diameter, while the Cisco SFP-10G-LR works only with SMF type of cable. The MMF range from OM1-OM5. OM is for Optical Multimode. OM1 type cables have a diameter of 62.5 micrometer, while all other types (OM2-OM5) have a diameter of 50 micrometer. So, it is important to know what is being done to avoid mixing them up.",

    "page_content": "To all show and more commands (except show technical support) an output modifier may be added as follows: <show/more command> | <output-modifier> <regular-expression-pattern> The output modifiers are: begin: Start output from the first line that has a sequence of characters matching thegiven regular expression pattern include: Includes only lines that have a sequence of characters matching the given regular expression pattern. exclude: Excludes all lines that have a sequence of characters matching the given regular expression pattern. count: Counts all lines that have a sequence of characters matching the given regular expression pattern and displays the result (no other output is displayed). Note Only 1 output modifier can be used in each command. The remainder of the text typed in is part of the regular expression pattern. A regular expression is a pattern (a phrase, number, or more complex pattern). The CLI String Search feature matches regular expressions to the show or more command output. Regular expressions are case-sensitive and allow for complex matching requirements. A regular expression can be a single-character pattern or a multiple-character pattern. That is, a regular expression can be a single character that matches the same single character in the command output or multiple characters that match the same multiple characters in the command output. The pattern in the command output is referred to as a string. This section describes creating both single-character patterns and multiple-character patterns. It also discusses creating more complex regular expressions, using multipliers, alternation, anchoring, and parentheses. Single-Character Patterns The simplest regular expression is a single character that matches the same single character in the command output. You can use any letter (A-Z, a-z) or digit (0-9) as a single-character pattern. You can also use other keyboard characters (such as ! or ~) as single-character patterns, but certain keyboard characters have special meaning when used in regular expressions. The following table lists the keyboard characters that have special meanings Character Meaning . Matches any single character, including white space. * Matches 0 or more sequences of the pattern. + Matches 1 or more sequences of the pattern. ? Matches 0 or 1 occurrences of the pattern. ^ Matches the beginning of the string. $ Matches the end of the string. To use these special characters as single-character patterns, remove the special meaning by preceding each character with a backslash (). The following examples are single-character patterns matching a dollar sign, an underscore, and a plus sign, respectively. $ _ + You can specify a range of single-character patterns to match against command output. For example, you can create a regular expression that matches a string containing one of the following letters: a, e, i, o, or u. Only one of these characters must exist in the string for pattern matching to succeed. To specify a range of single-character patterns, enclose the single-character patterns in square brackets ([ ]). For example, [aeiou] matches any one of the five vowels of the lowercase alphabet, while [abcdABCD] matches any one of the first four letters of the lower- or uppercase alphabet. You can simplify ranges by entering only the endpoints of the range separated by a dash (-). Simplify the previous range as follows: [a-dA-D] To add a dash as a single-character pattern in your range, include another dash and precede it with a backslash: [a-dA-D-] You can also include a right square bracket (]) as a single-character pattern in your range, as shown here: [a-dA-D-] The previous example matches any one of the first four letters of the lower- or uppercase alphabet, a dash, or a right square bracket. You can reverse the matching of the range by including a caret (^) at the start of the range. The following example matches any letter except the ones listed: [^a-dqsv] The following example matches anything except a right square bracket (]) or the letter d: [^]d] Multiple-Character Patterns When creating regular expressions, you can also specify a pattern containing multiple characters. You create multiple-character regular expressions by joining letters, digits, or keyboard characters that do not have special meaning. For example, a4% is a multiple-character regular expression. With multiple-character patterns, order is important. The regular expression a4% matches the character a followed by a 4 followed by a % sign. If the string does not have a4%, in that order, pattern matching fails. The multiple-character regular expression a. uses the special meaning of the period character to match the letter a followed by any single character. With this example, the strings ab, a!, or a2 are all valid matches for the regular expression. You can remove the special meaning of the period character by inserting a backslash before it. For example, when the expression a. is used in the command syntax, only the string a. will be matched. You can create a multiple-character regular expression containing all letters, all digits, all keyboard characters, or a combination of letters, digits, and other keyboard characters. For example, telebit 3107 v32bis is a valid regular expression. Multipliers You can create more complex regular expressions that instruct the system to match multiple occurrences of a specified regular expression. To do so, use some special characters with your single-character and multiple-character patterns. Table 1 lists the special characters that specify multiples of a regular expression. Table 1. Table 1: Special Characters Used as Multipliers Character Description * Matches 0 or more single-character or multiple-character patterns. + Matches 1 or more single-character or multiple-character patterns. ? Matches 0 or 1 occurrences of a single-character or multiple-character pattern. The following example matches any number of occurrences of the letter a, including none: a* The following pattern requires that at least one letter a be in the string to be matched: a+ The following pattern matches the string bb or bab: ba?b The following string matches any number of asterisks (*): * To use multipliers with multiple-character patterns, enclose the pattern in parentheses. In the following example, the pattern matches any number of the multiple-character string ab: (ab)* The following pattern matches one or more instances of alphanumeric pairs, but not none (that is, an empty string is not a match): ([A-Za-z][0-9])+ The order for matches using multipliers (*, +, or ?) is to put the longest construct first. Nested constructs are matched from outside to inside. Concatenated constructs are matched beginning at the left side of the construct. Thus, the regular expression above matches A9b3, but not 9Ab3 because the letters are specified before the numbers. Alternation Alternation allows you to specify alternative patterns to match against a string. You separate the alternative patterns with a vertical bar (|). Only one of the alternatives can match the string. For example, the regular expression codex|telebit either matches the string codex or the string telebit, but not both codex and telebit. Anchoring You can instruct the system to match a regular expression pattern against the beginning or the end of the string. You anchor these regular expressions to a portion of the string using the special characters shown in Table 2. Table 2. Table 2: Special Characters Used for Anchoring Character Description ^ Matches the beginning of the string. $ Matches the end of the string. For example, the regular expression ^con matches any string that starts with con, and $sole matches any string that ends with sole. In addition to indicating the beginning of a string, the ^ symbol can be used to indicate the logical function not when used in a bracketed range. For example, the expression [^abcd] indicates a range that matches any single letter, as long as it is not the letters a, b, c, or d.",

    "page_content": "To allow a single host (client) or multiple hosts on an IEEE 802.1X-authorized port, use the dot1x host-mode command in Interface Configuration mode. To restore the default configuration, use the no form of this command. Syntax dot1x host-mode {multi-host | single-host | multi-sessions} Parameters multi-host\u2014Enable multiple-hosts mode. single-host\u2014Enable single-hosts mode. multi-sessions\u2014Enable multiple-sessions mode. Default Configuration Default mode is multi-host. Command Mode Interface (Ethernet) Configuration mode User Guidelines Single-Host Mode The single-host mode manages the authentication status of the port: the port is authorized if there is an authorized host. In this mode, only a single host can be authorized on the port. When a port is unauthorized and the guest VLAN is enabled, untagged traffic is remapped to the guest VLAN. Tagged traffic is dropped unless the VLAN tag is the guest VLAN or the unauthenticated VLANs. If guest VLAN is not enabled on the port, only tagged traffic belonging to the unauthenticated VLANs is bridged. When a port is authorized, untagged and tagged traffic from the authorized host is bridged based on the static vlan membership configured at the port. Traffic from other hosts is dropped. A user can specify that untagged traffic from the authorized host will be remapped to a VLAN that is assigned by a RADIUS server during the authentication process. In this case, tagged traffic is dropped unless the VLAN tag is the RADIUS-assigned VLAN or the unauthenticated VLANs. The switch removes from FDB all MAC addresses learned on a port when its authentication status is changed from authorized to unauthorized. Multi-Host Mode The multi-host mode manages the authentication status of the port: the port is authorized after at least one host is authorized. When a port is unauthorized and the guest VLAN is enabled, untagged traffic is remapped to the guest VLAN. Tagged traffic is dropped unless the VLAN tag is the guest VLAN or the unauthenticated VLANs. If guest VLAN is not enabled on the port, only tagged traffic belonging to the unauthenticated VLANs is bridged. When a port is authorized, untagged and tagged traffic from all hosts connected to the port is bridged based on the static vlan membership configured at the port. A user can specify that untagged traffic from the authorized port will be remapped to a VLAN that is assigned by a RADIUS server during the authentication process. In this case, tagged traffic is dropped unless the VLAN tag is the RADIUS assigned VLAN or the unauthenticated VLANs. The switch removes from FDB all MAC addresses learned on a port when its authentication status is changed from authorized to unauthorized. Multi-Sessions Mode Unlike the single-host and multi-host modes (port-based modes) the multi-sessions mode manages the authentication status for each host connected to the port (session-based mode). If the multi-sessions mode is configured on a port the port does have any authentication status. Any number of hosts can be authorized on the port. The command can limit the maximum number of authorized hosts allowed on the port. Each authorized client requires a TCAM rule. If there is no available space in the TCAM, the authentication is rejected. When using the dot1x host-mode command to change the port mode to single-host or multi-host when authentication is enabled, the port state is set to unauthorized. If the dot1x host-mode command changes the port mode to multi-session when authentication is enabled, the state of all attached hosts is set to unauthorized. To change the port mode to single-host or multi-host, set the port (dot1x port-control) to force-unauthorized, change the port mode to single-host or multi-host, and set the port to authorization auto. Tagged traffic belonging to the unauthenticated VLANs is always bridged regardless if a host is authorized or not. When the guest VLAN is enabled, untagged and tagged traffic from unauthorized hosts not belonging to the unauthenticated VLANs is bridged via the guest VLAN. Traffic from an authorized hosts is bridged in accordance with the port static configuration. A user can specify that untagged and tagged traffic from the authorized host not belonging to the unauthenticated VLANs will be remapped to a VLAN that is assigned by a RADIUS server during the authentication process. The switch does not remove from FDB the host MAC address learned on the port when its authentication status is changed from authorized to unauthorized. The MAC address will be removed after the aging timeout expires. 802.1x enabled on a port associated with a port channel has the following limitations: Only the 802.1X-based authentication is supported. Only the multi-host (legacy 802.1x mode) mode is supported. Exampleswitchxxxxxx(config)  interface gi1/0/1 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  dot1x host-mode multi-host",

If the parameter is omitted, this option is applied by default. static\u2014If the RADIUS server authorized the supplicant, but did not provide a supplicant VLAN, the supplicant is accepted. Default Configuration reject Command Mode Interface (Ethernet) Configuration mode User Guidelines If RADIUS provides invalid VLAN information, the authentication is rejected. If a RADIUS server assigns a client with a non-existing VLAN, the switch creates the VLAN. The VLAN is removed when it is no longer being used. If RADIUS provides valid VLAN information and the port does not belong to the VLAN received from RADIUS, it is added to the VLAN as an egress untagged port. When the last authorized client assigned to the VLAN becomes unauthorized or 802.1x is disabled on the port, the port is excluded from the VLAN. If the authentication mode is single-host or multi-host, the value of PVID is set to the VLAN_ID. If an authorized port in the single-host or multi-host mode changes its status to unauthorized, the port static configuration is reset. If the authentication mode is multi-sessions mode, the PVID is not changed and all untagged traffic and tagged traffic not belonging to the unauthenticated VLANs are mapped to the VLAN using TCAM. If the last authorized host assigned to a VLAN received from RADIUS connected to a port in the multi-sessions mode changes its status to unauthorized, the port is removed from the VLAN if it is not in the static configuration. See the User Guidelines of the dot1x host-mode command for more information. If 802.1X is disabled the port static configuration is reset. If the reject keyword is configured and the RADIUS server authorizes the host but the RADIUS accept message does not assign a VLAN to the supplicant, authentication is rejected. If the static keyword is configured and the RADIUS server authorizes the host then even though the RADIUS accept message does not assign a VLAN to the supplicant, authentication is accepted and the traffic from the host is bridged in accordance with port static configuration. If this command is used when there are authorized ports/hosts, it takes effect at subsequent authentications. To manually re-authenticate, use the dot1x re-authenticate command. Examples Example 1.

(Range: 0\u201365535) match-all list-of-flags\u2014List of TCP flags that should occur. If a flag should be set, it is prefixed by \u201c+\u201d. If a flag should be unset, it is prefixed by \u201c-\u201d. Available options are +urg, +ack, +psh, +rst, +syn, +fin, -urg, -ack, -psh, -rst, -syn and -fin. The flags are concatenated to a one string. For example: +fin-ack. time-range-name\u2014Name of the time range that applies to this permit statement. (Range: 1\u201332) log-input\u2014Specifies sending an informational SYSLOG message about the packet that matches the entry. Because forwarding/dropping is done in hardware and logging is done in software, if a large number of packets match an ACE containing a log-input keyword, the software might not be able to match the hardware processing rate, and not all packets will be logged. Default Configuration No IPv4 access list is defined. Command Mode IP Access-list Configuration mode User Guidelines If a range of ports is used for source port in an ACE, it is not counted again, if it is also used for a source port in another ACE. If a range of ports is used for the destination port in an ACE, it is not counted again if it is also used for destination port in another ACE. If a range of ports is used for source port it is counted again if it is also used for destination port. If ace-priority is omitted, the system sets the rule's priority to the current highest priority ACE (in the current ACL) + 20. The ACE-priority must be unique per ACL.If the user types already existed priority, then the command is rejected.

Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines IPv6 ACL is defined by a unique name. IPv4 ACL, IPv6 ACL, MAC ACL or policy maps cannot have the same name. Every IPv6 ACL has an implicit permit icmp any any nd-ns any, permit icmp any any nd-na any, and deny ipv6 any any statements as its last match conditions. (The former two match conditions allow for ICMPv6 neighbor discovery.) The IPv6 neighbor discovery process uses the IPv6 network layer service, therefore, by default, IPv6 ACLs implicitly allow IPv6 neighbor discovery packets to be sent and received on an interface. In IPv4, the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), which is equivalent to the IPv6 neighbor discovery process, uses a separate data link layer protocol; therefore, by default, IPv4 ACLs implicitly allow ARP packets to be sent and received on an interface.

Default Configuration No ACL is assigned. Default action for ACL is deny-any. Command Mode Interface Configuration mode (Ethernet, Port-Channel,VLAN ) User Guidelines The following rules govern when ACLs can be bound or unbound from an interface: IPv4 ACLs and IPv6 ACLs can be bound together to an interface. A MAC ACL cannot be bound on an interface which already has an IPv4 ACL or IPv6 ACL bound to it. Two ACLs of the same type cannot be bound to a port. An ACL cannot be bound to a port that is already bound to an ACL, without first removing the current ACL. Both ACLs must be mentioned at the same time in this command. MAC ACLs that include a VLAN as match criteria cannot be bound to a VLAN. ACLs with time-based configuration on one of its ACEs cannot be bound to a VLAN. ACLs with the action Shutdown cannot be bound to a VLAN. When the user binds ACL to an interface, TCAM resources will be consumed. One TCAM rule for each MAC or IP ACE and two TCAM rules for each IPv6 ACE.The TCAM consumption is always even number, so in case of odd number of rules the consumption will be increased by 1. An ACL cannot be bound as input if it has been bound as output.

The name may contain maximum 32 characters. deny/permit\u2014Denies/permits access if the conditions are matched. src-addr[/src-len] | any\u2014 IP prefix defined as an IP address and length or any. The any value matches all IP addresses. If src-len is not defined, a value of 32 is applied. A value of src-len must be in the interval 1-32. Default Configuration No access list is defined. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines Use the ip access-list command to configure IP address filtering. Access lists are configured with permit or deny keywords to either permit or deny an IP address based on a matching condition. An implicit deny is applied to address that does not match any access-list entry. An access-list entry consists of an IP address and a bit mask. The bit mask is a number from 1 to 32. Evaluation of an IP address by an access list starts with the first entry of the list and continues down the list until a match is found. When the IP address match is found, the permit or deny statement is applied to that address and the remainder of the list is not evaluated. Use the no ip access-list command to delete the access list. The IPv4 standard access list is used to filter received and sent IPv4 routing information. Examples Examples Example 1 - The following example of a standard access list allows only the three specified networks. Any IP address that does not match the access list statements will be rejected. switchxxxxxx(config)  ip access-list 1 permit 192.168.34.0/24 switchxxxxxx(config)  ip access-list 1 permit 10.88.0.0/16 switchxxxxxx(config)  ip access-list 1 permit 10.0.0.0/8 Note: all other access is implicitly denied. Example 2 - The following example of a standard access list allows access for IP addresses in the range from 10.29.2.64 to 10.29.2.127. All IP addresses not in this range will be rejected. switchxxxxxx(config)  ip access-list apo permit 10.29.2.64/26 Note: all other access is implicitly denied. Example 3 - To specify a large number of individual addresses more easily, you can omit the mask length if it is 32. Thus, the following two configuration commands are identical in effect: switchxxxxxx(config)  ip access-list 2aa permit 10.48.0.3 switchxxxxxx(config)  ip access-list 2aa permit 10.48.0.3/32",

In the group address the last 4 bytes of the address are checked for match. In the source address the last 3 bytes and 5th from last bytes of the interface ID are examined. (*) Note that (*,G) cannot be written to the FDB if the mode is ip-src-group. In that case, no new FDB entry is created, but the port is added to the (S,G) entries (if they exist) that belong to the requested group.

(Range: 1\u20131000000) Default Configuration The feature is disabled by default. The default mode is discard. The default number of seconds is zero, but if traps is entered, a number of seconds must also be entered. Command Mode Interface (Ethernet, Port Channel) Configuration mode User Guidelines The command may be used only when the interface in the regular (non-secure with unlimited MAC learning) mode. Port Security cannot be enabled on an interface if 802.1X authentication is already active on the interface. When the port security command enables the lock mode on a port all dynamic addresses learned on the port are changed to permanent secure addresses. When the port security command enables a mode on a port differing from the lock mode all dynamic addresses learned on the port are deleted.

This method is usually used as fall back if the previous methods are not reachable. local Specifies that the local database should be used for commands authorization. This method is usually used as a fall back if the previous methods are not reachable. tacacs Uses the list of all TACACS+ servers for commands authorization. Default Configuration The Default method list exists, using none as the only method Command Mode Global configuration mode User Guidelines Use the aaa authorization commands command to specify a method list for authorizing commands executed by the user. If the method list includes more than one method, then the methods are used in the order specified in the command. A secondary method will be used only if the previous method is un-reachable. Command authorization will not be applied to a configuration mode command unless the aaa authorization config-commands is also configured on the device. Use the no form of the command to return the default method list to its default (none is the only method), or to delete a named method list that was created by the user. If local is defined as a method the commands will be authorized based on the credentials provided by the user and according to their privilege level. This means that a level 1 user will be able to execute all of the level 1 commands and a level 15 user will be able to execute all of the level 15 commands. If the credentials used for login are not part of the local database then execution for all of the commands will fail. This method is usually used as a backup in case the main method (for example tacacs) is not reachable. It prevents command execution lockout in this case. The none and if-authenticated are also used usually as backup method. If none is defined as a method \u2013 then the commands will always be authorized. The if-authenticated method functionality is similar to the none method functionality. However if the user did not provide any credentials when login in (for example authentication and authorization method list were none), then if none is defined as a command authorization list all commands will be authorized, and if the if-authenticated method is used all commands will be denied (since the user was not authenticated). In order to activate a method list it needs to be applied to a management interface (console, SSH or telnet) using the authorization commands line configuration mode command. Example The following example configures an authorization method list for level 15 commands. The authorization requests are sent to the list of the TACACS+ servers. If the TACACS+ servers do not respond, then the commands are still authorized (due to the none method). switchxxxxxx(config)  aaa authorization commands 15 auth_commands15 tacacs none",

The command is rejected if it is configured during a quiet-mode period. The no form of the command returns quiet-mode access-class to the default setting. On devices without a console the no command cannot be applied if login block-for command is configured. Examples Example 1 - The following example shows how to configure the device to accept connection during quiet mode period based on quiet-acl management access list: switchxxxxxx(config)  login quiet-mode access-class quiet-acl",

Character Repetition: A character cannot be repeated consecutively. The maximum number of repetition allowed is 3 by default. Minimum number of character classes: The number of different character classes that must be included in the password (classes are: uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number and special character). The minimum number is 3 by default and is configurable to 0-4 (0 and 1 are functionally identical). Any password established or altered by the user (hence \"Secret\") is compared to a list of common passwords. SecLists/Password Common Credentials If the secret contains a word from the list, the user will receive the following error message and will need to re-enter an alternative password: \"Password rejected- Passwords must not match words in the dictionary, and must not contain commonly used passwords\". Sequential characters \u2013 The password MUST NOT contain more than 2 sequential characters or numbers, or the reverse value of these sequences. Restriction also includes letters that are replaced with other characters, as follows: \"$\" for \"s\", \"@\" for \"a\", \"0\" for \"o\", \"1\" for \"l\", \"!\" for \"i\", \"3\" for \"e\". Examples for prohibited passwords: \u201cefg123!$\u201d, \u201cabcd765%\u201d, \u201ckji!$378\u201d, qr$58!230. Sequential letters are prohibited in any case combination (e.g. AbC or aBC). Context specific words (project and vendor name) \u2013 The password MUST NOT contain the username or the words \u201ccisco\u201d , \"catalyst\" or derivatives of such. This restriction includes these words reversed or in any case. Restriction also includes letters that are replaced with other characters, as follows: \"$\" for \"s\", \"@\" for \"a\", \"0\" for \"o\", \"1\" for \"l\", \"!\" for \"i\", \"3\" for \"e\", is not permitted. For example, C!$c0678! is not permitted. Known passwords are not allowed as passwords When the administrator configures a new enable password, this password is encrypted automatically and saved to the configuration file. No matter how the password was entered, it appears in the configuration file with the keyword encrypted and the encrypted value. The administrator is required to use the encrypted keyword only when actually entering an encrypted keyword. If the administrator wants to manually copy a password that was configured on one switch (for instance, switch B) to another switch (for instance, switch A), the administrator must add encrypted in front of this encrypted password when entering the enable command in switch A. In this way, the two switches will have the same password. The administrator is required to use the encrypted keyword only when actually entering an encrypted keyword. If the generate-password option is used, instead of entering a password the user will be presented with a randomly generated password suggestion. This suggestion will comply with all current password strength settings The user will be given the choice to accept or reject the proposed password. If the user elects to accept the password, then this password will be added for the configured enable level (in encrypted format) in the configuration file. If the user rejects the password suggestion, the command will need to be entered again to configure this enable level. Example Example 1 - The command sets a password that has already been encrypted.

The range is from 1 to 160 characters. owner\u2014specifies the owner of the certificate. This is a string of 1 to 32 characters. If an owner is not specified, the default owner is \"Static\". When adding a certificate, the certificate itself should follow the command on the command line. Default Configuration There are no installed certificates. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines Use the ca-certificate install name command to install a CA certificate. Following the command, the user will be prompted to enter the certificate in the command line. The user will need to enter or paste the certificate. Entering a period on a separate line indicates that the certificate input is complete. The entered certificate must use the pem format. A certificate will not be valid if the system clock was not set by user or synchronized with SNTP, or based on hardware based Real Time Clock (RTC). Up to 256 certificates can be installed. When using the no form of the command to remove certificates, a specific certificate can be removed by name. Alternatively, the owner keyword can be used to remove all static certificates belonging to a specific owner. Examples Example 1.

The cbd organization name, cbd network name, cbd address and cbd key settings must be configured for the cbd connection enable command to succeed. Use the no cbd connection enable to disconnect the Probe from the Cisco Business Dashboard\u200b and to allow the user to change the Cisco Business Dashboard\u200b settings mentioned above. Examples The following example enables the probe to connect to the Cisco Business Dashboard:switchxxxxxx(config)  cbd connection enable In the following example the command fails because some of the Dashboard settings needed for connection were not configured:switchxxxxxx(config)  cbd connection enable Command failed.

Capabilities\u2014The device type of the neighbor. This device can be a router, a bridge, a transparent bridge, a source-routing bridge, a switch, a host, an IGMP device, or a repeater. COS for Untrusted Ports\u2014The COS value with which all packets received on an untrusted port should be marked by a simple switching device which cannot itself classify individual packets. Device ID\u2014The name of the neighbor device and either the MAC address or the serial number of this device. Duplex\u2014The duplex state of connection between the current device and the neighbor device. Entry address(es)\u2014A list of network addresses of neighbor devices. Extended Trust\u2014The Extended Trust. External Port-ID\u2014Identifies the physical connector port on which the CDP packet is transmitted. It is used in devices, such as those with optical ports, in which signals from multiple hardware interfaces are multiplexed through a single physical port. It contains the name of the external physical port through which the multiplexed signal is transmitted. Interface\u2014The protocol and port number of the port on the current device. IP Network Prefix\u2014It is used by On Demand Routing (ODR). When transmitted by a hub router, it is a default route (an IP address). When transmitted by a stub router, it is a list of network prefixes of stub networks to which the sending stub router can forward IP packets. Management Address\u2014When present, it contains a list of all the addresses at which the device will accept SNMP messages, including those it will only accept when received on interface(s) other than the one over which the CDP packet is being sent. MTU\u2014The MTU of the interface via which the CDP packet is sent. Native VLAN\u2014The ID number of the VLAN on the neighbor device. Physical Location\u2014A character string indicating the physical location of a connector which is on, or physically connected to, the interface over which the CDP packet containing this TLV is sent. Platform\u2014The product name and number of the neighbor device. In the case of the Secondary Cache only the 8 last characters of the value are printed. Power Available\u2014Every switch interface transmits information in the Power Available TLV, which permits a device which needs power to negotiate and select an appropriate power setting. The Power Available TLV includes four fields. Power Consumption\u2014The maximum amount of power, in milliwatts, expected to be obtained and consumed from the interface over which the CDP packet is sent. Power Drawn\u2014The maximum requested power. Note: For IP Phones the value shown is the maximum requested power (6.3 Watts). This value can be different than the actual power supplied by the routing device (generally 5 watts; shown using the show power command). Protocol-Hello\u2014Specifies that a particular protocol has asked CDP to piggyback its \"hello\" messages within transmitted CDP packets. Remote Port_ID\u2014Identifies the port the CDP packet is sent on sysName\u2014An ASCII string containing the same value as the sending device's sysName MIB object. sysObjectID\u2014The OBJECT-IDENTIFIER value of the sending device's sysObjectID MIB object. Time To Live\u2014The remaining amount of time, in seconds, the current device will hold the CDP advertisement from a transmitting router before discarding it. Version\u2014The software version running on the neighbor device. Voice VLAN-ID\u2014The Voice VLAN-ID. VTP Management Domain\u2014A string that is the name of the collective group of VLANs associated with the neighbor device.",

Default Configuration Full token information is displayed Command Mode User EXEC mode User Guidelines Use this command to display the tokens that can be used as part of the text parameter in commands ip dhcp information option circuit-id or ip dhcp information option remote-id. The tokens represent various system info, which the user can include in either of the sub-options\u2019 payloads. This allows automatic update of value based on current system information and also based on relevant interfaces. The tokens have meaningful and pre-determined names based on the information they represent. A $ symbol is placed before and after the Token name ($token-name$). Tokens can be divided, in general, into 3 groups: Tokens which represent interface level information (format of $int-xxx$); Tokens which represent switch level information (format of $switch-xxx$), and tokens which represent VLAN related information (format of $vlan-xxx$).

Default Configuration There is no globally-defined relay destination. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines The ipv6 dhcp relay destination command specifies a destination address to which client messages are forwarded. The address is used by all DHCPv6 relays running on the switch. Up to 100 addresses can be defined. When a relay service is running on an interface, a DHCP for IPv6 message received on that interface will be forwarded to all configured relay destinations configured per interface and globally. Multiple destinations can be configured on one interface, and multiple output interfaces can be configured for one destination. Unspecified, loopback, and Multicast addresses are not acceptable as the relay destination. Use the no form of the command with the ipv6-address and interface-id arguments to remove only the given globally-defined address with the given output interface. Use the no form of the command with the ipv6-address argument to remove only the given globally-defined address for all output interfaces. The no form of the command without the arguments removes all the globally-defined addresses. Examples Example 1. The following example sets the relay unicast link-local destination address per VLAN 200: switchxxxxxx(config)  ipv6 dhcp relay destination FE80:1:2 vlan 200 Example 2. The following example sets that client messages are forwarded to VLAN 200: switchxxxxxx(config)  ipv6 dhcp relay destination vlan 200 Example 3. The following example sets the unicast global relay destination address: switchxxxxxx(config)  ipv6 dhcp relay destination 3002:1:2",

Syntax ipv6 dhcp relay destination [{ipv6-address [interface-id]} | interface-id] no ipv6 dhcp relay destination [{ipv6-address [interface-id]} | interface-id] Parameters ipv6-address [interface-id]\u2014Relay destination IPv6 address in the form documented in RFC 4291 where the address is specified in hexadecimal using 16-bit values between colons.

If this argument is configured, client messages are forwarded to the well-known link-local Multicast address All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers (FF02:1:2) through the link to which the output interface is connected. Default Configuration The relay function is disabled, and there is no relay destination on an interface. Command Mode Interface Configuration mode User Guidelines This command specifies a destination address to which client messages are forwarded, and it enables DHCP for IPv6 relay service on the interface. Up to 10 addresses can be defined per one interface and up to 100 addresses can be defined per switch. DHCPv6 Relay inserts the Interface-id option if an IPv6 global address is not defined on the interface on which the relay is running. The Interface-id field of the option is the interface name (a value of the ifName field of the ifTable) on which the relay is running. When relay service is running on an interface, a DHCP for IPv6 message received on that interface will be forwarded to all configured relay destinations configured per interface and globally. The incoming DHCP for IPv6 message may have come from a client on that interface, or it may have been relayed by another relay agent. The relay destination can be a Unicast address of a server or another relay agent, or it may be a Multicast address. There are two types of relay destination addresses: A link-local Unicast or Multicast IPv6 address, for which a user must specify an output interface A global Unicast IPv6 address. A user can optionally specify an output interface for this kind of address. If no output interface is configured for a destination, the output interface is determined by routing tables. In this case, it is recommended that a Unicast or Multicast routing protocol be running on the router. Multiple destinations can be configured on one interface, and multiple output interfaces can be configured for one destination. When the relay agent relays messages to a Multicast address, it sets the hop limit field in the IPv6 packet header to 32. Unspecified, loopback, and node-local Multicast addresses are not acceptable as the relay destination. Note that it is not necessary to enable the relay function on an interface for it to accept and forward an incoming relay reply message from servers. By default, the relay function is disabled, and there is no relay destination on an interface. Use the no form of the command with arguments to remove a specific address. Use the no form of the command without arguments to remove all the defined addresses and to disable the relay on the interface. Examples Example 1. The following example sets the relay Unicast link-local destination address per VLAN 200 and enables the DHCPv6 Relay on VLAN 100 if it was not enabled: switchxxxxxx(config)  interface vlan 100 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  ipv6 dhcp relay destination FE80:1:2 vlan 200 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  exitExample 2. The following example sets the relay well known Multicast link-local destination address per VLAN 200 and enables the DHCPv6 Relay on VLAN 100 if it was not enabled: switchxxxxxx(config)  interface vlan 100 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  ipv6 dhcp relay destination vlan 200 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  exitExample 3.

This command controls how much time the hosts have to answer an IGMP query message before the router deletes their group. Configuring a value of fewer than 10 seconds enables the router to prune groups faster. The maximum query response time must be less than the query interval. Note. If the hosts do not respond fast enough, they might be pruned inadvertently. Therefore, the hosts must know to respond faster than 10 seconds (or the value you configure).

If the IGMP Querier election mechanism is enabled, the IGMP Snooping querier supports the standard IGMP Querier election mechanism specified in RFC2236 and RFC3376. If IGMP Querier election mechanism is disabled, IGMP Snooping Querier delays sending General Query messages for 60 seconds from the time it was enabled. During this time, if the switch did not receive an IGMP query from another Querier - it starts sending General Query messages. Once the switch acts as a Querier, it will stop sending General Query messages if it detects another Querier on the VLAN. In this case, the switch will resume sending General Query messages if it does hear another Querier for Query Passive interval that equals to <Robustness>*<Query Interval> + 0.5*<Query Response Interval). It is recommended to disable IGMP Querier election mechanism if there is an IPM Multicast router on the VLAN.

Syntax Bluetooth Interface ip address ip-address {mask | /prefix-length} no ip address In-Band interfaces: ip address ip-address {mask | /prefix-length} no ip address [ip-address] Parameters ip-address\u2014Specifies the IP address. mask\u2014Specifies the network mask of the IP address. prefix-length\u2014Specifies the number of bits that comprise the IP address prefix. The prefix length must be preceded by a forward slash (/). (Range: 8\u201330) Default Configuration No IP address is defined for interfaces. Command Mode Interface (Ethernet, Port Channel, Bluetooth) Configuration mode User Guidelines Use the ip address command to define a static IP address on an interface. In-Band interfaces Multiple IP addresses are supported. A new defined IP address is added on the interface. Defining a static IP address on an interface stops a DHCP client running on the interface and removes the IP address assigned by the DHCP client. If a configured IP address overlaps another configured one a warning message is displayed. To change an existed IP address, delete the existed one and add the new one. While no IP address is assigned either by DHCP client or manually the default IP address 192.168.1.254 is assigned on the Default VLAN. Bluetooth interface One IP address is supported. A new IP address defined on the Bluetooth interface overrides the previously defined IP address. The IP address configured on the Bluetooth interface cannot be on the same subnet as the addresses configured on the In-Band interfaces. The IP address on the Bluetooth interface does not support routing capabilities. Examples Example 1.

Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines This command forwards specific UDP Broadcast packets from one interface to another, by specifying a UDP port number to which UDP broadcast packets with that destination port number are forwarded. By default, if no UDP port number is specified, the device forwards UDP broadcast packets for the following six services: IEN-116 Name Service (port 42) DNS (port 53) NetBIOS Name Server (port 137) NetBIOS Datagram Server (port 138) TACACS Server (port 49) Note TACACS is not supported on the C1200 models. Time Service (port 37) Many helper addresses may be defined. However, the total number of address-port pairs is limited to 128 for the device. The setting of a helper address for a specific interface has precedence over the setting of a helper address for all the interfaces. Forwarding of BOOTP/DHCP (ports 67, 68) cannot be enabled with this command. Use the DHCP relay commands to relay BOOTP/DHCP packets. The ip-interface argument cannot be the OOB port.

Command Mode Key Chain Key Configuration mode User Guidelines The switch checks Time-of-Date again a value of the start-time argument regardless if Time-of-Date is not set by management or by SNTP because of the default value of Time-of-Date always is an passed time. If validation of the value of the start-time argument was passed and the end-time argument is configured and its value is infinite the key is considered as actual regardless if Time-of-Date is not set by management or by SNTP. If Time-of-Date is not set by management or by SNTP and if the end-time argument is configured with a value differing from infinite or the duration parameter is configured, the key is considered as expired. If Time-of-Date is set by management or by SNTP, the switch checks Time-of-Date again a value of the end-time argument or of the duration parameter. If the last key expires, authentication will be finished with error. Example The following example configures a key chain called keychain1. The key named string1 will be accepted from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. and be sent from 2:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. The key named string2 will be accepted from 2:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. and be sent from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. The overlap allows for migration of keys or discrepancies in the set time of the router.

Default Configuration The cryptographic algorithm is not set by default. Command Mode Key Chain Key Configuration mode User Guidelines Configuring the cryptographic-algorithm command defines the algorithm to use for each key in the key-chain. The same algorithm must be configured for the same key ID on the link partner interface. Configuring a cryptographic algorithm for a key is mandatory for OSPF key-chain based authentication (command ip ospf authentication with key-chain option). If a key-chain used for OSPF authentication includes a key-id not configured with a cryptographic algorithm, then: If this is the only key in the key-chain, then OSPF packets are not sent on the IP interface and OSPF packets received on the IP interface are dropped. If the key-chain includes additional keys then only the keys configured with a cryptographic algorithm will be used. If a certain time-range (commands accept-lifetime or send-lifetime) is covered only by the key without a cryptographic algorithm, then during this time-range OSPF packets are not sent on the IP interface and OSPF packets received on the IP interface are dropped. RIP key-chain based authentication (command ip rip authentication key-chain) supports only MD5 authentication. Therefore: If a \"cryptographic-algorithm\" was not configured for a key, then RIP authentication will use the specified key using the MD5 algorithm. If a \"cryptographic-algorithm\" was used to configure MD5 algorithm for a key, then RIP authentication will use the specified key using the MD5 algorithm. If a \"cryptographic-algorithm\" was used to configure any other (non MD5) algorithm for a key, then the key will not be used for RIP authentication. Example The following example configures a key chain called keychain1, with a key named string1. The cryptographic algorithm is set to hmac-sha-256: switchxxxxxx(config)  key chain keychain1 switchxxxxxx(config-keychain)  key 1 switchxxxxxx(config-keychain-key)  key-string string1 switchxxxxxx(config-keychain-key)  cryptographic-algorithm hmac-sha-256 switchxxxxxx(config-keychain-key)  exit",

The key identification numbers need not be consecutive. The scope of a key identification number is the key chain where the key is defined. Default Configuration No key exists on the key chain. Command Mode Key-Chain Configuration mode User Guidelines It is useful to have multiple keys on a key chain so that the software can sequence through the keys as they become invalid after time, based on the accept-lifetime and send-lifetime key chain key command settings. Each key has its own key identifier, which is stored locally. The combination of the key identifier and the interface associated with the message uniquely identifies the authentication algorithm and authentication key in use. Only one authentication packet is sent, regardless of the number of valid keys. The software starts looking at the lowest key identifier number and uses the first valid key. If the last key expires, authentication will be finished with error. To remove all keys, remove the key chain by using the no key chain command. Example The following example configures a key chain named chain1. The key named key1 will be accepted from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. and be sent from 2:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. The key named key2 will be accepted from 2:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. and be sent from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. The overlap allows for migration of keys or a discrepancy in the set time of the router.

(Range: Valid IP address) Command Mode Privileged EXEC mode User Guidelines The traceroute command works by taking advantage of the error messages generated by routers when a datagram exceeds its time-to-live (TTL) value. The traceroute command starts by sending probe datagrams with a TTL value of one. This causes the first router to discard the probe datagram and send back an error message. The traceroute command sends several probes at each TTL level and displays the round-trip time for each. The traceroute command sends out one probe at a time. Each outgoing packet can result in one or two error messages. A \"time exceeded\u201d error message indicates that an intermediate router has seen and discarded the probe. A \"destination unreachable\" error message indicates that the destination node has received the probe and discarded it because it could not deliver the packet. If the timer goes off before a response comes in, the traceroute command prints an asterisk (*). The traceroute command terminates when the destination responds, when the maximum TTL is exceeded, or when the user interrupts the trace with Esc. The traceroute ipv6 command is not relevant to IPv6 link local addresses. Exampleswitchxxxxxx> traceroute ip umaxp1.physics.lsa.umich.edu Type Esc to abort.

A decimal value that indicates how many of the high-order contiguous bits of the address comprise the prefix (the network portion of the address). A slash mark must precede the decimal value. Default Configuration No IP address is defined for the interface. Command Mode Interface Configuration mode User Guidelines An Anycast address is an address that is assigned to a set of interfaces that typically belong to different nodes. A packet sent to an Anycast address is delivered to the closest interface\u2014as defined by the routing protocols in use\u2014identified by the Anycast address. Anycast addresses are syntactically indistinguishable from Unicast addresses because Anycast addresses are allocated from the Unicast address space. Nodes to which the Anycast address is assigned must be explicitly configured to recognize that the address is an Anycast address. Anycast addresses can be used only by a router, not a host, and Anycast addresses must not be used as the source address of an IPv6 packet. The subnet router Anycast address has a prefix concatenated by a series of zeros (the interface ID). The subnet router Anycast address can be used to reach a router on the link that is identified by the prefix in the subnet router Anycast address. The ipv6 address anycast command cannot be applied to define an IPv6 address on an ISATAP interface.

Syntax ipv6 address autoconfig no ipv6 address autoconfig Default Configuration Stateless Auto configuration is enabled. Command Mode Interface Configuration mode User Guidelines This command enables IPv6 on an interface (if it was disabled) and causes the switch to perform IPv6 stateless address auto-configuration to discover prefixes on the link and then to add the eui-64 based addresses to the interface. Stateless auto configuration is applied only when IPv6 Forwarding is disabled. When IPv6 forwarding is changed from disabled to enabled, and stateless auto configuration is enabled the switch stops stateless auto configuration and removes all stateless auto configured ipv6 addresses from all interfaces. When IPv6 forwarding is changed from enabled to disabled and stateless auto configuration is enabled the switch resumes stateless auto configuration.

Default Configuration The default interval is 100ms and the default bucketsize is 10 i.e. 100 ICMP error messages per second. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines Use this command to limit the rate at which IPv6 ICMP error messages are sent. A token bucket algorithm is used with one token representing one IPv6 ICMP error message. Tokens are placed in the virtual bucket at a specified interval until the maximum number of tokens allowed in the bucket is reached. The milliseconds argument specifies the time interval between tokens arriving in the bucket. The optional bucketsize argument is used to define the maximum number of tokens allowed in the bucket. Tokens are removed from the bucket when IPv6 ICMP error messages are sent, which means that if the bucketsize is set to 20, a rapid succession of 20 IPv6 ICMP error messages can be sent. When the bucket is empty of tokens, IPv6 ICMP error messages are not sent until a new token is placed in the bucket. Average Packets Per Second = (1000/ milliseconds) * bucketsize. To disable ICMP rate limiting, set the milliseconds argument to zero. Example The following example shows an interval of 50 milliseconds and a bucket size of 20 tokens being configured for IPv6 ICMP error messages: switchxxxxxx(config)  ipv6 icmp error-interval 50 20",

To return the number of messages to the default value, use the no form of this command. Syntax ipv6 nd dad attempts value no ipv6 nd dad attempts Parameters value\u2014The number of neighbor solicitation messages. The acceptable range is from 0 to 600. Configuring a value of 0 disables duplicate address detection processing on the specified interface; a value of 1 configures a single transmission without follow-up transmissions. Default Configuration 1 Command Mode Interface Configuration mode User Guidelines Duplicate address detection verifies the uniqueness of new Unicast IPv6 addresses before the addresses are assigned to interfaces (the new addresses remain in a tentative state while duplicate address detection is performed). Duplicate address detection uses neighbor solicitation messages to verify the uniqueness of Unicast IPv6 addresses. The DupAddrDetectTransmits node configuration variable (as specified in RFC 4862, IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration) is used to automatically determine the number of consecutive neighbor solicitation messages that are sent on an interface, while duplicate address detection is performed on a tentative Unicast IPv6 address. The interval between duplicate address detection, neighbor solicitation messages (the duplicate address detection timeout interval) is specified by the neighbor discovery-related variable RetransTimer (as specified in RFC 4861, Neighbor Discovery for IPv6), which is used to determine the time between retransmissions of neighbor solicitation messages to a neighbor when resolving the address or when probing the reachability of a neighbor. This is the same management variable used to specify the interval for neighbor solicitation messages during address resolution and neighbor unreachability detection. Duplicate address detection is suspended on interfaces that are administratively down. While an interface is administratively down, the Unicast IPv6 addresses assigned to the interface are set to a pending state. Duplicate address detection is automatically restarted on an interface when the interface returns to being administratively up. An interface returning to administratively up, restarts duplicate address detection for all of the Unicast IPv6 addresses on the interface. While duplicate address detection is performed on the link-local address of an interface, the state for the other IPv6 addresses is still set to TENTATIVE. When duplicate address detection is completed on the link-local address, duplicate address detection is performed on the remaining IPv6 addresses. When duplicate address detection identifies a duplicate address, the state of the address is set to DUPLICATE and the address is not used. If the duplicate address is the link-local address of the interface, the processing of IPv6 packets is disabled on the interface and an error SYSLOG message is issued. If the duplicate address is a global address of the interface, the address is not used and an error SYSLOG message is issued. All configuration commands associated with the duplicate address remain as configured while the state of the address is set to DUPLICATE. If the link-local address for an interface changes, duplicate address detection is performed on the new link-local address and all of the other IPv6 address associated with the interface are regenerated (duplicate address detection is performed only on the new link-local address). Note. Since DAD is not supported on NBMA interfaces the command is allowed but does not impact on an IPv6 tunnel interface of the ISATAP type it does not impact. The configuration is saved and will impacted when the interface type is changed on another type on which DAD is supported (for example, to the IPv6 manual tunnel). Example The following example configures five consecutive neighbor solicitation messages to be sent on VLAN 1 while duplicate address detection is being performed on the tentative Unicast IPv6 address of the interface. The example also disables duplicate address detection processing on VLAN 2. switchxxxxxx(config)  interface vlan 1 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  ipv6 nd dad attempts 5 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  exit switchxxxxxx(config)  interface vlan 2 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  ipv6 nd dad attempts 0 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  exit",

The prefix will be advertised with the L-bit clear. Default Configuration All prefixes configured on interfaces that originate IPv6 router advertisements are advertised with a valid lifetime of 2,592,000 seconds (30 days) and a preferred lifetime of 604,800 seconds (7 days). Note that by default: All prefixes are inserted in the routing table as connected prefixes. All prefixes are advertised as on-link (for example, the L-bit is set in the advertisement) All prefixes are advertised as an auto-configuration prefix (for example, the A-bit is set in the advertisement) Command Mode Interface Configuration mode User Guidelines This command enables control over the individual parameters per prefix, including whether the prefix should be advertised. Use the ipv6 nd prefix ipv6-prefix/prefix-length command to add the prefix to the Prefix table. Use the no ipv6 nd prefix ipv6-prefix/prefix-length command to remove the prefix from the Prefix table. Use the no ipv6 nd prefix command without the ipv6-prefix/prefix-length argument o remove all prefixes from the Prefix Table. Note. The no ipv6 nd prefix command does not return the default values to the original default values. The switch supports the following advertisement algorithm: Advertise all prefixes that are configured as addresses on the interface using the parameters defined by the ipv6 nd prefix default command (or the default value if the command has not been configured) except refixes that are placed in the Prefix table (changed (configured) by the ipv6 nd prefix command). Advertise all prefixes configured by the ipv6 nd prefix command without the no-advertise keyword. Default Keyword The default keyword can be used to set default values for automatic advertised prefixes configured as addresses on the interface using the ipv6 address command. Note. These default values are not used as the default values in the ipv6 nd prefix command. Use the no ipv6 nd prefix default command to return the default values to the original default values. On-Link When on-link is \u201con\u201d (by default), the specified prefix is assigned to the link. Nodes sending traffic to such addresses that contain the specified prefix consider the destination to be locally reachable on the link. An on-link prefix is inserted into the routing table as a Connected prefix. Auto-configuration When auto-configuration is on (by default), it indicates to hosts on the local link that the specified prefix can be used for IPv6 auto-configuration. The configuration options affect the L-bit and A-bit settings associated with the prefix in the IPv6 ND Router Advertisement, and presence of the prefix in the routing table, as follows: Default L=1 A=1, In the Routing Table no-onlink L=0 A=1, In the Routing Table no-autoconfig L=1 A=0, In the Routing Table no-onlink no-autoconfig L=0 A=0, In the Routing Table off-link L=0 A=1, Not in the Routing Table off-link no-autoconfig L=0 A=0, Not in the Routing Table Examples Example 1. The following example includes the IPv6 prefix 2001:0DB8:/35 in router advertisements sent out VLAN 1 with a valid lifetime of 1000 seconds and a preferred lifetime of 900 seconds. The prefix is inserted in the Routing table: switchxxxxxx(config)  interface vlan 1 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  ipv6 nd prefix 2001:0DB8:/35 1000 900 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  exit Example 2.

To restore the default time, use the no form of this command. Syntax ipv6 nd reachable-time milliseconds no ipv6 nd reachable-time Parameters milliseconds\u2014Amount of time that a remote IPv6 node is considered reachable (in milliseconds). The acceptable range is from 0 to 3600000 milliseconds. Default Configuration 0 milliseconds (unspecified) is advertised in router advertisements and the value 30000 (30 seconds) is used for the neighbor discovery activity of the router itself. Command Mode Interface Configuration mode User Guidelines The configured time enables the router to detect unavailable neighbors. Shorter configured times enable the router to detect unavailable neighbors more quickly; however, shorter times consume more IPv6 network bandwidth and processing resources in all IPv6 network devices. Very short configured times are not recommended in normal IPv6 operation. The configured time is included in all router advertisements sent out of an interface so that nodes on the same link use the same time value. A value of 0 means indicates that the configured time is unspecified by this router. Example The following example configures an IPv6 reachable time of 1,700,000 milliseconds for VLAN 1:switchxxxxxx(config)  interface vlan 1 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  ipv6 nd reachable-time 1700000 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  exit",

Default Configuration Static entries are not configured in the IPv6 neighbor discovery cache. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines Use the ipv6 route ipv6-prefix/prefix-length interface-id [metric] command to define a static route, if the outgoing interface is a manual tunnel. If the next-ipv6-address argument is a global IPv6 address that belongs to an on-link prefix you can omit the outgoing-interface-id argument and in this case the L2 interface on which this on-link prefix is defined will be used as the outgoing interface. If the outgoing-interface-id argument is configured it overrides this switch decision. If the next-ipv6-address argument is a global IPv6 address that does not belong to any on-link prefix you must configure the outgoing-interface-id argument. If the next-ipv6-address argument is a link-local IPv6 address and the outgoing-interface-id argument is omitted the zone of the next-ipv6-address argument will be used as the outgoing interface. If the outgoing-interface-id argument is configured it overrides this zone. Examples Example 1.

It is the lowest value of a range of the length (the \u201cfrom\u201d portion of the length range). le le-value\u2014Specifies a prefix length less than or equal to the /prefix-length argument. It is the highest value of a range of the length (the \u201cto\u201d portion of the length range). Default Configuration No prefix list is created. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines This command without the seq keyword adds the new entry after the last entry of the prefix list with the sequence number equals to the last number plus 5. For example, if the last configured sequence number is 43, the new entry will have the sequence number of 48. If the list is empty, the first prefix-list entry is assigned the number 5 and subsequent prefix list entries increment by 5. This command with the seq keyword puts the new entry into the place specified by the parameter, if an entry with the number exists it is replaced by the new one. This command without the seq keyword removes the prefix list. The no version of this command with the seq keyword removes the specified entry. The sequence number of a prefix list entry determines the order of the entries in the list. The router compares network addresses to the prefix list entries. The router begins the comparison at the top of the prefix list, with the entry having the lowest sequence number. If multiple entries of a prefix list match a prefix, the entry with the lowest sequence number is considered the real match. Once a match or deny occurs, the router does not go through the rest of the prefix list. For efficiency, you might want to put the most common permits or denies near the top of the list, using the seq-number argument. IPv6 prefix lists are used to specify certain prefixes or a range of prefixes that must be matched before a permit or deny statement can be applied. Two operand keywords can be used to designate a range of prefix lengths to be matched. A prefix length of less than, or equal to, a value is configured with the le keyword. A prefix length greater than, or equal to, a value is specified using the ge keyword. The ge and le keywords can be used to specify the range of the prefix length to be matched in more detail than the usual ipv6-prefix/prefix-length argument. For a candidate prefix to match against a prefix list entry the following conditions must exist: The candidate prefix must match the specified prefix list and prefix length entry The value of the optional le keyword specifies the range of allowed prefix lengths from 0 up to the value of the le-length argument, and including, this value. The value of the optional ge keyword specifies the range of allowed prefix lengths from the value of the ge-length argument up to, and including, 128. Note that the first condition must match before the other conditions take effect. An exact match is assumed when the ge or le keywords are not specified. If only one keyword operand is specified then the condition for that keyword is applied, and the other condition is not applied. The prefix-length value must be less than the ge value. The ge value must be less than, or equal to, the le value. The le value must be less than or equal to 128. Every IPv6 prefix list, including prefix lists that do not have permit and deny condition statements, has an implicit deny any any statement as its last match condition. Formal Specification Checked prefix is cP and checked prefix length is cL. Function PrefixIsEqual(P1, P2, L) compares the first L bits of two addresses P1 and P2 and returns TRUE if they are equal. Case 1. A prefix-list entry is: P - prefix address L - prefix length ge - is not defined le - is not defined The prefix cP/cL matches the prefix-list entry if PrefixIsEqual(cP,P,L) & cL = L Case 2. An prefix-list entry is: P - prefix address L - prefix length ge - is defined le - is not defined The prefix cP/cL matches the prefix-list entry if PrefixIsEqual(cP,P,L) & cL >= ge Case 3. An prefix-list entry is: P - prefix address L - prefix length ge - is not defined le - is defined The prefix cP/cL matches to the prefix-list entry if PrefixIsEqual(cP,P,L) & cL <= le Case 4. An prefix-list entry is: P - prefix address L - prefix length ge - is defined le - is defined The prefix cP/cL matches the prefix-list entry if PrefixIsEqual(cP,P,L) & ge <= cL <= le Examples Example 1. The following example denies all routes with a prefix of :/0: switchxxxxxx(config)  ipv6 prefix-list abc deny :/0 Example 2. The following example permits the prefix 2002:/16: switchxxxxxx(config)  ipv6 prefix-list abc permit 2002:/16 Example 3.

    "page_content": "Use the macro name Global Configuration mode command to define a macro. There are two types of macros that can be defined: Global macros define a group of CLI commands that can be run at any time. Smartport macros are associated with Smartport types. For each Smartport macro there must be an anti macro (a macro whose name is concatenated with no_). The anti macro reverses the action of the macro. If a macro with this name already exists, it overrides the previously-defined one. Use the no form of this command to delete the macro definition. Syntax macro name macro-name no macro name [macro-name] Parameters macro-name\u2014Name of the macro. Macro names are case sensitive. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines A macro is a script that contains CLI commands and is assigned a name by the user. It can contain up to 3000 characters and 200 lines. Keywords Macros may contain keywords (parameters). The following describes these keywords: A macro can contain up to three keywords. All matching occurrences of the keyword are replaced by the corresponding value specified in the macro command. Keyword matching is case-sensitive Applying a macro with keywords does not change the state of the original macro definition. User Feedback The behavior of a macro command requiring user feedback is the same as if the command is entered from terminal: it sends its prompt to the terminal and accepts the user reply. Creating a Macro Use the following guidelines to create a macro: Use macro name to create the macro with the specified name. Enter one macro command per line. Use the @ character to end the macro. Use the   character at the beginning of a line to enter a comment in the macro. In addition,   is used to identify certain preprocessor commands that can only be used within a macro. There are two possible preprocessor commands:  macro key description - Each macro can be configured with up to 3 keyword/description pairs. The keywords and descriptions are displayed in the GUI pages when the macro is displayed. The syntax for this preprocessor command is as follows:  macro key description $keyword1 description1 $keyword2 description2 $keyword3 description3 A keyword must be prefixed with '$'.  macro keywords - This instruction enables the device to display the keywords as part of the CLI help. It accepts up to 3 keywords. The command creates a CLI help string with the keywords for the macro. The help string will be displayed if help on the macro is requested from the macro and macro global commands. The GUI also uses the keywords specified in the command as the parameter names for the macro. See Example 2 and 3 below for a description of how this command is used in the CLI. The syntax for this preprocessor command is as follows:  macro keywords $keyword1 $keyword2 $keyword3 where $keywordn is the name of the keyword. Editing a Macro Macros cannot be edited. Modify a macro by creating a new macro with the same name as the existing macro. The newer macro overwrites the existing macro. The exceptions to this are the built-in macros and corresponding anti-macros for the Smartport feature. You cannot override a Smartport macro. Scope of Macro It is important to consider the scope of any user-defined macro. Because of the potential hazards of applying unintended configurations, do not change configuration modes within the macro by using commands such as exit, end, or interface interface-id. With a few exceptions, there are other ways of executing macros in the various configuration modes. Macros may be executed in Privileged Exec mode, Global Configuration mode, and Interface Configuration mode (when the interface is NOT a VLAN.) Examples Example 1 -The following example shows how to create a macro that configures the duplex mode of a port. switchxxxxxx(config)  macro name dup Enter macro commands one per line. End with the character \u2018@\u2019.  macro description dup duplex full negotiation @ Example 2 -The following example shows how to create a macro with the parameters: DUPLEX and SPEED. When the macro is run, the values of DUPLEX and SPEED must be provided by the user. The  macro keywords command enables the user to receive help for the macro as shown in Example 3. switchxxxxxx(config)  macro name duplex Enter macro commands one per line. End with the character \u2018@\u2019. duplex $DUPLEX no negotiation speed $SPEED  macro keywords $DUPLEX $SPEED @ Example 3 -The following example shows how to display the keywords using the help character ? (as defined by the  macro keywords command above) and then run the macro on the port. The  macro keywords command entered in the macro definition enables the user to receive help for the macro, as shown after the words e.g. below. switchxxxxxx(config)  interface gi1/0/1 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  macro apply duplex ? WORD <1-32> Keyword to replace with value e.g. $DUPLEX, $SPEED <cr> switchxxxxxx(config-if)  macro apply duplex $DUPLEX ?

You can enter up to three parameter-value pairs. Parameter keyword matching is case sensitive. All matching occurrences of the parameter name in the macro are replaced with the corresponding value. Default Configuration The command has no default setting. Command Mode Interface (Ethernet, Port Channel) Configuration mode User Guidelines The macro apply command hides the commands of the macro from the user while it is being run. The macro trace command displays the commands along with any errors which are generated by them as they are executed. This is used to debug the macro and find syntax or configuration errors. When you run a macro, if a line in it fails because of a syntax or configuration error, the macro continues to apply the remaining commands to the interface. If you apply a macro that contains parameters in its commands, the command fails if you do not provide the values for the parameters. You can use the macro apply macro-name with a '?' to display the help string for the macro keywords (if you have defined these with the  macro keywords preprocessor command). Parameter (keyword) matching is case sensitive. All matching occurrences of the parameter are replaced with the provided value. Any full match of a keyword, even if it is part of a large string, is considered a match and replaced by the corresponding value. When you apply a macro to an interface, the switch automatically generates a macro description command with the macro name. As a result, the macro name is appended to the macro history of the interface. The show parser macro command displays the macro history of an interface. A macro applied to an interface range behaves the same way as a macro applied to a single interface. When a macro is applied to an interface range, it is applied sequentially to each interface within the range. If a macro command fails on one interface, it is nonetheless attempted to be applied and may fail or succeed on the remaining interfaces. Examples Example 1 - The following is an example of a macro being applied to an interface with the trace option. switchxxxxxx(config)  interface gi1/0/2 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  macro trace dup $DUPLEX full $SPEED 100 Applying command\u2026 \u2018duplex full\u2019 Applying command\u2026 \u2018speed 100\u2019 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  Example 2 - The following is an example of a macro being applied without the trace option. switchxxxxxx(config)  interface gi1/0/2 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  macro apply dup $DUPLEX full $SPEED 100 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  Example 3 - The following is an example of an incorrect macro being applied. switchxxxxxx(config)  interface gi1/0/1 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  macro trace dup Applying command.'duplex full' Applying command.'speed auto' % bad parameter value switchxxxxxx(config-if) ",

You can enter up to three parameter-value pairs. Parameter keyword matching is case sensitive. All matching occurrences of the parameters are replaced with the corresponding value. Default Configuration The command has no default setting. Command Mode Global Configuration mode. User Guidelines If a command fails because of a syntax error or a configuration error when you apply a macro, the macro continues to apply the remaining commands to the switch. Keyword matching is case sensitive. All matching occurrences of the keyword are replaced with the corresponding value. Any full match of a keyword, even if it is part of a large string, is considered a match and replaced by the corresponding value. If you apply a macro that contains keywords in its commands, the command fails if you do not specify the proper values for the keywords when you apply the macro. You can use this command with a '?' to display the help string for the macro keywords. You define the keywords in the help string using the preprocessor command  macro keywords when you define a macro. When you apply a macro in Global Configuration mode, the switch automatically generates a global macro description command with the macro name. As a result, the macro name is appended to the global macro history.

This command controls how much time the hosts have to answer an MLD query message before the router deletes their group. Configuring a value of fewer than 10 seconds enables the router to prune groups faster. The maximum query response time must be less than the query interval. Note. If the hosts do not respond fast enough, they might be pruned inadvertently. Therefore, the hosts must know to respond faster than 10 seconds (or the value you configure).

If the MLD Querier election mechanism is enabled, the MLD Snooping querier supports the standard MLD Querier election mechanism specified in RFC2710 and RFC3810. If MLD Querier election mechanism is disabled, MLD Snooping Querier delays sending General Query messages for 60 seconds from the time it was enabled. During this time, if the switch did not receive an IGMP query from another Querier - it starts sending General Query messages. Once the switch acts as a Querier, it will stop sending General Query messages if it detects another Querier on the VLAN. In this case, the switch will resume sending General Query messages if it does hear another Querier for Query Passive interval that equals to <Robustness>*<Query Interval> + 0.5*<Query Response Interval).

The encryption algorithm used is Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) privacy algorithm in Cipher Feedback Mode (CFB) using 128 bits encryption keys), encrypted-priv-password\u2014(Optional) Specifies the privacy password in encrypted format. Default Configuration No group entry exists. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User GuidelinesFor SNMP v1 and v2, this command performs the same actions as snmp-server community-group, except that snmp-server community-group configures both v1 and v2 at the same time. With this command, you must perform it once for v1 and once for v2. A local SNMP EngineID must be defined in order to add SNMPv3 users to the device. For remote hosts users a remote SNMP EngineID is also required. Changing or removing the value of snmpEngineID deletes the SNMPv3 users\u2019 database. The logical key of the command is username. Configuring a remote host is required in order to send informs to that host, because an inform is a trap that requires acknowledgment. A configured remote host is also able to manage the device (besides getting the informs). To configure a remote user, specify the IP address for the remote SNMP agent of the device where the user resides. Also, before you configure remote users for a particular agent, configure the SNMP engine ID, using the snmp-server engineID remote command. The remote agent's SNMP engine ID is needed when computing the authentication and privacy digests from the password. If the remote engine ID is not configured first, the configuration command fails. Since the same group may be defined several times, each time with different version or different access level (noauth, auth or auth & priv), when defining a user it is not sufficient to specify the group name, rather you must specify group name, version and access level for complete determination of how to handle packets from this user. Example This example assigns user tom to group abcd using SNMP v1 and v2c. . User jerry is assigned to group efgh using SNMP v3. switchxxxxxx(config)  snmp-server user tom acbd v1 switchxxxxxx(config)  snmp-server user tom acbd v2c switchxxxxxx(config)  snmp-server user jerry efgh v3 auth sha pass1234",

Fifth octet: Set to 3 to indicate the MAC address that follows. Last 6 octets: The device MAC address. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines To use SNMPv3, an engine ID must be specified for the device. Any ID can be specified or the default string, which is generated using the device MAC address, can be used. As the engineID should be unique within an administrative domain, the following guidelines are recommended: Configure a non-default EngineID, and verify that it is unique within the administrative domain. Changing or removing the value of snmpEngineID deletes the SNMPv3 users database. The SNMP EngineID cannot be all 0x0 or all 0xF or 0x000000001.

Only a single match criteria in this class map must be matched. Default Configuration No class map. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines The class-map command and its subcommands are used to define packet classification, marking, and aggregate policing as part of a globally-named service policy applied on a per-interface basis. A class map consists of one or more ACLs. It defines a traffic flow by determining which packets match some or all of the criteria specified in the ACLs. All class map commands are only available when QoS is in advanced mode. The class-map enters Class-map Configuration mode. In this mode, up to two match commands can be entered to configure the criteria for this class. Each match specifies an ACL. When using a few match commands, each must point to a different type of ACL, such as: one IP ACL, one IPv6 ACL, and one MAC ACL. The classification is by first match, therefore, the order of the ACLs is important. Error messages are generated in the following cases: There is more than one match command in a match-all class map There is a repetitive classification field in the participating ACLs. After entering the Class-map Configuration mode, the following configuration commands are available: exit: Exits the Class-map Configuration mode. match: Configures classification criteria. no: Removes a match statement from a class map. Example The following example creates a class map called Class1 and configures it to check that packets match all classification criteria in the ACL specified. switchxxxxxx(config)  class-map class1 match-all switchxxxxxx(config-cmap)  match access-group acl-name",

DSCP remarking will have effect only if the mode is trust dscp. Default Configuration No aggregate policer is defined. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines This command is only available when QoS is in advanced mode. Use the qos aggregate-policer command to define a policer that aggregates traffic from multiple class maps. Aggregate policers cannot aggregate traffic from multiple devices. If the aggregate policer is applied to more than one device, the traffic on each device is counted separately and is limited per device. Traffic from two different ports on the same device can be aggregated for policing purposes. An aggregate policer can be applied to multiple classes in the same policy map. An aggregate policer cannot be deleted if it is being used in a policy map. The no police aggregate Policy-map Class Configuration mode command must first be used to delete the aggregate policer from all policy maps before using the no qos aggregate-policer command. Policing uses a token bucket algorithm. CIR represents the speed with which the token is added to the bucket. CBS represents the depth of the bucket. Examples Example 1. The following example defines the parameters of a policer called policer1 that can be applied to multiple classes in the same policy map. When the average traffic rate exceeds 124,000 kbps or the normal burst size exceeds 9600 bytes, the packet is dropped. switchxxxxxx(config)  qos aggregate-policer policer1 124000 9600 exceed-action dropExample 2.

If number-of-queues = 0, all queues are assured forwarding (according to wrr weights) If the number-of-queues = 8 , all the queues are expedited (strict priority queues). Default Configuration All queues are expedite queues. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines An expedite queue is a strict priority queue, which is serviced until empty before the other lower priority queues are serviced. the weighted round robin (WRR) weight ratios are affected by the number of expedited queues, because there are fewer queues participating in WRR. This indicates that the corresponding weight in the wrr-queue bandwidth Interface Configuration mode command is ignored (not used in the ratio calculation). Example The following example configures the number of expedite queues as 2.switchxxxxxx(config)  priority-queue out num-of-queues 2",

Octets Total number of octets of data (including those in bad packets and excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) received on the network. Packets Number of packets (including bad packets) received during this sampling interval. Broadcast Number of good packets received during this sampling interval that were directed to the broadcast address. Multicast Number of good packets received during this sampling interval that were directed to a multicast address. This number does not include packets addressed to the broadcast address. Utilization Best estimate of the mean physical layer network utilization on this interface during this sampling interval, in hundredths of a percent. CRC Align Number of packets received during this sampling interval that had a length (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) between 64 and 1518 octets, inclusive, but had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Undersize Number of packets received during this sampling interval that were less than 64 octets long (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) and were otherwise well formed. Oversize Number of packets received during this sampling interval that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) but were otherwise well formed. Fragments Total number of packets received during this sampling interval that were less than 64 octets in length (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) and had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error), or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). It is normal for etherHistoryFragments to increment because it counts both runts (which are normal occurrences due to collisions) and noise hits. Jabbers Number of packets received during this sampling interval that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets), and had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Dropped Total number of events in which packets were dropped by the probe due to lack of resources during this sampling interval. This number is not necessarily the number of packets dropped, it is the number of times this condition has been detected. Collisions Best estimate of the total number of collisions on this Ethernet segment during this sampling interval.",

Syntax set router hardware-routing active Parameters This command has no arguments or keywords. Command Mode Privileged EXEC mode User Guidelines Hardware based routing is supported automatically on device once IPv4 or IPv6 route is enabled. However, hardware based routing is de-activated automatically by the software in cases where device hardware resources cannot support the amount of IPv4 and/or IPv6 entries. IPv4 entries - IPv4 interfaces/addresses and routes and as well as IPv4 Multicast entries; IPv6 entries - IPv6 interfaces/addresses and routes as well as IPv6 Multicast entries; Once Hardware based routing is de-activated by the system the user needs to apply the set router hardware-routing active command to re-activate hardware based routing on device. It is recommended to adjust the number of IPv4 and/or IPv6 entries on device to match the device hardware capabilities Once command is applied, the device begins to update all existing IP entries to device hardware tables. If process succeeds - hardware based routing will be re-activated. If process fails (for example device hardware resource are still not sufficient to support current device IP entries), hardware routing status will remain in-active. Syslog messages will indicate to user the start of the hardware table update process and the success or failure of such update. Examples Example 1. The following example the process of reactivating hardware based routing is applied. switchxxxxxx  set router hardware-routing active This operation may take a few moments. Example 2. In the following example, command is applied, but hardware based routing is already active on the device. switchxxxxxx  set router hardware-routing active Hardware based routing aleady active",

Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines Use the system resources command to enter new settings for the maximum supported number of policy based routes and/or VLAN mapping entries. After entering the command, the current setting will be displayed, and the user will be required to confirm saving the new setting to the startup-configuration, following which system needs to be rebooted to apply changes. When this command is included in a configuration file that is downloaded to the device, if it is downloaded to the running configuration file, the command will be rejected. If it is downloaded to the startup configuration file, the device will not reboot automatically. The new settings will be used after the device is rebooted manually. Allocating additional resources for policy based routes and/or VLAN mapping entries, means that there are less resources to be used by IP type entries. Out of the entries allocated for VLAN Mapping - 8 entries are reserved for system use, and cannot be used for user based VLAN Mapping configuration. Data Validation: If the new policy based route and/or VLAN mapping values cannot be supported by device (due to relevant resource being used by other applications), the command is rejected and a message is displayed to the user. If the new max-number parameter is lower than the actual number of entries currently in-use settings, a confirmation message is displayed to the user (before the save confirmation message). Use the no system resources command to restore the default settings. Examples Example 1 - The following example defines the supported number of entries for IPv4 policy based routes,IPv6 policy based routes and/or VLAN mapping. switchxxxxxx(config)  system resources policy-ip-routes 20 policy-ipv6-routes 32 vlan-mapping-entries 100 In-Use Reserved (Current) Reserved (New) - - - IPv4 policy Routes 8 16 20 IPv6 policy Routes 8 16 32 VLAN Mapping Entries 32 32 100 Setting the new configuration of entries requires saving the running-configuration file to startup-configuration file and rebooting the system, do you want to continue? (Y/N) [N] Y Example 2 - In the following example, the configured entries are less than the entries which are currently in use by the device. Using this configurations means that the system may not have enough resources for the running again in the existing network: switchxxxxxx(config)  system resources policy-ip-routes 8 policy-ipv6-routes 8 vlan-mapping-routes 16 In-Use Reserved (Current) Reserved (New) - - - IPv4 policy Routes 10 20 8 IPv6 policy Routes 10 32 8 VLAN Mapping Entries 50 100 16 1) In one or more of the parameters, the new max entry configuration is less than the entries which are currently in use by the system, do you want to continue? 2) Setting the new configuration of entries requires saving the running-configuration file to startup-configuration file and rebooting the system.

If unspecified, defaults to the lowest IP address of the device (when the certificate is generated). ou organization-unit\u2014Specifies the organization-unit or department name. (Length: 1\u201364 characters) or organization\u2014Specifies the organization name. (Length: 1\u201364 characters) loc location\u2014Specifies the location or city name. (Length: 1\u201364 characters) st state\u2014Specifies the state or province name. (Length: 1\u201364 characters) cu country\u2014Specifies the country name. (Length: 2 characters) duration days\u2014Specifies the number of days a certification is valid. (Range: 30\u20131095) Default Configuration If the key-generate parameter is not used the certificate is generated using the existing key. The default SSL\u2019s RSA key length is 2048. The default SSL\u2019s EC key length is 256. If cn common- name is not specified, it defaults to the device\u2019s lowest static IPv6 address (when the certificate is generated), or to the device\u2019s lowest static IPv4 address if there is no static IPv6 address, or to 0.0.0.0 if there is no static IP address. If duration days is not specified, it defaults to 730 days. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines If the specific certificate key does not exist, you must use the parameter key-generate. If both certificates 1 and 2 have been generated, use the ip https certificate command to activate one of them. See Keys and Certificates for information on how to display and copy this key pair. Erasing the startup configuration or returning to factory defaults automatically deletes the default keys and they are recreated during device initialization. Example The following example generates a self-signed certificate for HTTPS whose key length is 2048 bytes.switchxxxxxx(config)  crypto certificate 1 generate key-generate 2048",

Command Mode Privileged EXEC mode User Guidelines Use this command to export a certificate request to a Certification Authority. The certificate request is generated in Base64-encoded X.509 format. Before generating a certificate request, first generate a self-signed certificate using the crypto cerificate generate command to generate the keys. The certificate fields must be re-entered. After receiving the certificate from the Certification Authority, use the crypto cerificate import command to import the certificate into the device. This certificate replaces the self-signed certificate.

Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines Certificate needs to be imported from PEM encoding/file extension To end the session (return to the command line to enter the next command), enter a blank line. The imported certificate must be based on a certificate request created by the crypto cerificate request command.

Default Configuration Administrative state is Disabled Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines Regardless of the status of Auto Smartport, you can always manually apply a Smartport macro to its associated Smartport type. A Smartport macro is either a built-in macro or a user-defined macro. You can define and apply a macro using the CLI commands presented in the Macro Commands section. If the Auto Smartport Administrative state is controlled, the Auto Smartport Operational state is managed by the Voice VLAN manager and is set as follows: Auto Smartport Operational state is disabled when the OUI Voice VLAN is enabled. Auto Smartport Operational state is enabled when the Auto Voice VLAN is enabled. A user cannot enable Auto Smartport globally if the OUI Voice VLAN is enabled. Example This example shows an attempt to enable the Auto Smartport feature globally in the controlled mode. This is not possible because the OUI voice feature is enabled. The voice VLAN state is then disabled, after which Auto Smartports can be enabled. The appropriate VLANs are automatically enabled because the ports are configured for Auto Smartports on these VLANs. switchxxxxxx(config)  macro auto controlled switchxxxxxx(config)  macro auto enabled Auto smartports cannot be enabled because OUI voice is enabled. switchxxxxxx(config)  voice vlan state disabled switchxxxxxx(config)  macro auto enabled switchxxxxxx(config)  10-Apr-2011 16:11:31 %LINK-I-Up: Vlan 20 10-Apr-2011 16:11:33 %LINK-I-Up: Vlan 5 10-Apr-2011 16:11:33 %LINK-I-Up: Vlan 6 10-Apr-2011 16:11:33 %LINK-I-Up: Vlan 7 10-Apr-2011 16:11:33 %LINK-I-Up: Vlan 8 10-Apr-2011 16:11:33 %LINK-I-Up: Vlan 9 10-Apr-2011 16:11:33 %LINK-I-Up: Vlan 10",

Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines The scope of each parameter is the macro in which it is defined, with the exception of the parameter $voice_vlan, which is a global parameter and its value is specified by the switch and cannot be defined in a macro. The macros must be defined before linking them in this command. Smartport macros must be disconnected from the Smartport type before removing them (using the no version of this command). To associate a Smartport type with a user-defined macros, you must have defined a pair of macros: one to apply the configuration, and the other (anti macro) to remove the configuration. The macros are paired by their name. The name of the anti macro is the concatenation of no_ with the name of the corresponding macro. Please refer to the Macro Command section for details about defining macro.

Command Mode VLAN Configuration mode User Guidelines Use the remote-span command to define a VLAN as a RSPAN remote VLAN. Only one Remote VLAN can be defined per switch. The Remote VLAN must be created manually before configuring of the remote-span command. Guest VLAN cannot be configured as a Remote VLAN. All traffic into a RSPLAN VLAN is tagged and MAC learning is disabled in a RSPAN VLAN. The remote-span command verifies that all ports of the configured VLAN are egress tagged ports and disables MAC learning. The no remote-span command resets MAC learning. Note. The membership of a RSPAN remote VLAN depended where it is defined: Source or Start switch\u2014It is recommended that the RSPAN remote VLAN does not have any memberships. Intermediate switch\u2014It is recommended to remove the RSPAN remote VLAN from trunk ports not used for passing mirrored traffic to avoid superfluous flooding.

Syntax spanning-tree mst instance instance-id no spanning-tree mst instance instance-id Parameters instance-id\u2014Specifies the spanning-tree instance ID. (range 1-4094) Default Configuration Instance IDs 1-4094 do not exist. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines Use the spanning-tree mst instance command to create an MST instance. Up to 15 can be created. Instance 0 (the common and internal spanning tree (CIST) instance) exists by default on device and cannot be removed. Creating an MST instance allows to map VLANs to this instance in MST Configuration mode) and to configure the following settings on the created instance: Configure instance priority - command spanning-tree mst priority. Configure port priority per instance - command spanning-tree mst port-priority Configure port cost per instance - command spanning-tree mst cost Use the no form of command to delete an instance. An instance cannot be deleted if one or more VLANs are still mapped to it. Deleting an instance removes all STP configuration related to that instance. Example Example 1. The following example creates an MST instance with instance ID of 248: switchxxxxxx(config) spanning-tree mst instance 248 Example 2:The following example removes MST instance 248 from device. switchxxxxxx(config)  no spanning-tree mst instance 248 Example 3:In the following example removal of instance ID 365 fails because VLANs are still mapped to this instance: switchxxxxxx(config)  no spanning-tree mst instance 365 Cannot delete instance 365. One or more VLANs are mapped to this instance.",

If the control plane is not defined as a source for an OPC session then the activation of the session (command monitor capture start) will fail. Use the in, out, or both keyword to define the direction of the traffic that will be captured. The in direction means that only the traffic to the CPU will be captured. The out direction means that only the traffic from the CPU will be captured. The both direction means that both traffic from and to the CPU will be captured. If the command is defined multiple times, the direction defined in the most recent command will be the used as the capture direction. This command can be applied only for an OPC session that is not active. If the OPC session named by the user already exists then this command will enable control plane packet capture for the existing OPC session. If the OPC session named by the user does not exist, then this command will create the OPC session and enable control plane packet capture for it. Up to 4 OPC sessions are supported. Use the no monitor capture capture-name control-plane command to disable control-plane capturing. Use the no monitor capture capture-name control-plane both command to disable control-plane capturing. Use the no monitor capture capture-name control-plane in command to disable ingress traffic control-plane capturing. If only the in direction was defined for this OPC session, then monitor capture for the control plane will be disabled. If the out or both direction were defined for this capture session, then the capture will continue on the output traffic direction of the control plane. Use the no monitor capture capture-name control-plane out command to disable egress traffic control-plane capturing. If only the out direction was defined for this OPC session, then monitor capture for the control plane will be disabled. If the in or both direction were defined for this capture session, then the capture will continue on the ingress traffic direction of the control plane. Examples Example 1: The following command enables packet capture on both directions of the control plane for OPC session cap3. If cap3 does not exist, this command will also create the OPC session: switchxxxxxx  monitor capture cap3 control-plane both Example 2: The following example enables traffic capture on the ingress control plane traffic for an existing OPC session cap3. If cap3 does not exist, this command will also create the OPC session: switchxxxxxx  monitor capture cap3 control-plane in Example 3: The execution of the command in the next example fails because the capture has been activated on OPC session cap3: switchxxxxxx  monitor capture cap3 control-plane out Cannot modify - Capture point is currently active. Example 4: The following example disables control plane traffic capture for cap3 OPC session: switchxxxxxx  no monitor capture cap3 control-plane Example 5: The following example disables traffic capture only for the control plane egress direction: switchxxxxxx  no monitor capture cap3 control-plane out",

(range 0-4,294,967,295) Default Usage The certificate is displayed without a signature. If the sign parameter is specified without a nonce value then the signature will be generated without using a nonce. Command Mode Privileged EXEC mode User Guidelines The show platform certificate command displays the device SUDI or AIK (Attestation Identity Key) certificate. The command output includes the certificate chain in PEM format, where the first certificate that is displayed is the Cisco Root CA, and the second certificate that is displayed is the Cisco published on https:/www.cisco.com/security/pki/. The third certificate is the SUDI or AIK leaf certificate. If the optional sign parameter is used, then the command output will display a signature over the certificates using either the SUDI (if sudi keyword is used) or AIK (if attestation keyword is used) private key. The command also supports an optional [nonce <nonce value>] parameter used as part of the signature inputs to prevent replay attacks. If the [nonce <nonce value>] parameter is not provided the signed data will not include the nonce. The command output includes a signature version. Signature value of 1 indicates that the SUDI private key was used for signing, while a signature value of 2 indicates that the AIK private key was used for signing.

    "page_content": "Use the show platform hardware integrity Privileged EXEC mode command to display chip protection information, including the content of PCR-15 (PCR - Platform Configuration Register) of the Active unit, and optionally a signature over the PCR or the PCR Quote included in command output display. Syntax show platform hardware integrity [attestation] [sign [nonce <nonce>] Parameters sign\u2014(Optional) display a signature over PCR-15 or PCR-15 Quote. attestation - (Optional) use the attestation (AIK) private key to sign the PCR-15 Quote. If the attestation is not specified then the SUDI private key is used to sign PCR-15. [nonce <nonce value>]\u2014(Optional) provide a nonce to use with the signature to protect from replay attacks. (range 0-4,294,967,295) Default Usage PCR information is displayed without a signature. If the sign keyword is specified without a nonce value then the signature will be generated without using a nonce. If the attestation keyword is not specified then the SUDI private key will be used to sign the PCR. Command Mode Privileged EXEC mode User Guidelines The show platform hardware integrity command provides on demand chip protection attestation. The command displays the content of the Active unit PCR (Platform Configuration Register) 15. PCR-15 is the extension of the device unique chip IDs. If the sign keyword is used, then the command output will display a signature over PCR-15. If the attestation keyword is used then the command output will include also a PCR Quote and the signature will be over the quote. The command also supports an optional [nonce <nonce value>] parameter used as part of the signature inputs to prevent replay attacks. If the [nonce <nonce value>] parameter is not provided the signed data will not include the nonce. The command output includes a signature version. A signature value of 1 indicates that the SUDI private key was used for signing PCR-15. A signature value of 2 indicates that the attestation (AIK) private key was used for signing the PCR Quote. Examples Example 1: The following example displays the contents of PCR-15 without a signature: switchxxxxxx> show platform hardware integrity PCR15: b45f34da34c6b142569f2c4f36264f3d0dfadde33f7721ed4bfd7b329ec71e6c Example 2: The following example displays PCR-15 with a signature over PCR-15 using the SUDI private key with no nonce: switchxxxxxx> show platform hardware integrity sign PCR15: b45f34da34c6b142569f2c4f36264f3d0dfadde33f7721ed4bfd7b329ec71e6c Signature Version: 1 Signature: aba857b3c4a00191d6bc01617b5e73755810f0f4f67230e96de7a305f6882d94da9bdd2df3f12472 33f42fe0137b11971c128252e3a9813ec78d8640d87f284fc427db96b3412a07c24c78cda2242bd5 96c69ea06beb28feabfa014c48b96f420d65ffa725221319791e1f7c094acf743bbd48b7aafe088b 147894de42ca0e0634155432d8092b0ca82eb246ddb2de9a0bbd9a7914fdd7a1628dd5a29bbc4d02 9ddf846938e0b47f63bc488cf3dd2f439e684989ff39e834ac7534f5bc2187b293cfc5445af9a905 c8a3a5366fbc2cd74868912105ef4880a203772946ffae2de126cd769d111b362210bb9ce7a2af7b f423360a90ac8dde4aacc2b47a7cc923 Example 3: The following example displays PCR-15, PCR-15 Quote and the signature over the quote using the attestation (AIK) key with a nonce of 613: switchxxxxxx> show platform hardware integrity sign attestation nonce 613 PCR15: b45f34da34c6b142569f2c4f36264f3d0dfadde33f7721ed4bfd7b329ec71e6c Signature Version: 2 Quote: ff54434780180022000b9f2c580f14cf6f157964c1dc9fb17f8a9504b50976a120fb870831db9242 e5ac00207e5fab8920a8bbcd214d7ade666c74fc07f2aa41298ac81177dc9ba7f5af978100000000 002be9b5000000240000000001000201100000000000000001000b030080000020f508f73aab654d 716ae4a511616843ca53bdef8bb7959a26226dd4d477e7170b Signature: 36e4f4d5fecaa820cd9dfb879b170007e35eeb2edb1ddb9736580c3bd7aefc1312e6bb946573b8ef 45b9f97084b1648c704d4e54ff6aa854e2ebd4389c880b2c060be391e14d14a411cc675fe6cde688 cf3d688570eaf5bd08b69185f7dfcbbe2a5329939096aa47b0bea5fc0f1907029789f67fbb187d88 2dc69bf24dda351fc55846be38d233d40a164f30a82482f72733c9c33decb06376527034ab19490b fccbd8f4e108910fa0a923047f98e8c45ba9d9d8e28d134662c52d6ed5616d6fc33e40985b6c3921 644d3e53570c5bc17a7f4289cd46fb3f72a7e440720751889a2552395e9ef66ba9a6d8fe9b9a6aeb a74e43129fa5447ad9b7158401cd9174",

    "page_content": "Use the show platform integrity Privileged EXEC mode command to display Boot Integrity Visibility (BIV) information for the Active unit, and optionally a signature over the PCR or the PCR Quote included in command output display. Syntax show platform integrity [sign [attestation] [nonce <nonce>] Parameters sign\u2014(Optional) display a signature over the PCRs displayed in the command output or over the PCR Quote displayed in the command output. attestation\u2014(Optional) use the attestation (AIK) private key to sign the PCR Quote. If the attestation is not specified then the SUDI private key is used to sign the PCRs. [nonce <nonce value>]\u2014(Optional) provide a nonce to use with the signature to protect from replay attacks. (range 0-4,294,967,295) Default Usage PCR information is displayed without a signature. If the sign keyword is specified without a nonce value then the signature will be generated without using a nonce. If the attestation keyword is not specified then the SUDI private key will be used to sign the PCRs. Command Mode Privileged EXEC mode User Guidelines The show platform integrity command provides on demand Boot Integrity Visibility (BIV) attestation. The command displays the boot-up measurements of the Active unit boot-loader image and OS image. The measurements are displayed as hash values. In addition, the command output displays the contents of PCR-0 and PCR-8. PCR-0 is the extension of the boot-loader image hash, and PCR-8 is the extension of the OS image hash. If the sign keyword is used, then the command output will display a signature over PCR-0 and PCR-8. If the attestation keyword is used then the command output will include also a PCR Quote and the signature will be over the quote. The command also supports an optional [nonce <nonce value>] parameter used as part of the signature inputs to prevent replay attacks. If the [nonce <nonce value>] parameter is not provided the signed data will not include the nonce. The command output includes a signature version. Signature value of 1 indicates that the SUDI private key was used for signing PCR-0 and PCR-8, while a signature value of 2 indicates that the attestation (AIK) private key was used for signing the PCR Quote.

After a remote SSH client is successfully authenticated by public key, the client must still be AAA-authenticated to gain management access to the device, except if the auto-login parameter was specified. If no SSH authentication method is enabled, remote SSH clients must still be AAA-authenticated before being granted management access to the device. If the auto-login keyword is specified for SSH authentication by public key management access is granted if SSH authentication succeeds and the name of SSH used is found in the local user database. The device management AAA authentication is transparent to the user. If the user name is not in the local user database, then the user receives a warning message, and the user will need to pass the device management AAA authentication independently of the SSH authentication. If the auto-login keyword is not specified, management access is granted only if the user engages and passes both SSH authentication and device management AAA authentication independently.If no SSH authentication method is enabled management access is granted only if the user is AAA authenticated by the device management. No SSH authentication method means SSH is enabled and neither SSH authentication by public key nor password is enabled. Example The following example enables authentication of the SSH client.switchxxxxxx(config)  ip ssh pubkey-auth",

Default Configuration Access mode. Command Mode Interface (Ethernet, Port Channel) Configuration mode User Guidelines When the port\u2019s mode is changed, it receives the configuration corresponding to the mode. If the port mode is changed to access and the access VLAN does not exist, then the port does not belong to any VLAN.Use the switchport mode vlan-mapping {tunnel | one-to-one} command to configure a VLAN mapping mode of an edge interface of a Provider Edge switch. The edge interface is an interface where a Customer network is connected to the Provider Edge switch. The network which the switch belongs to is a Provider network. These networks (Customer ones and Provider one) can use the same VLAN-IDs and the edge interface must perform vlan mapping between Customer VLANs (C-VLANs) and Provider VLANs (S-VLANs).On an edge interface C-VLANs are mapped to S-VLANs and the original C-VLAN tags are kept as part of payload. When a frame is sent on non-edge tagged interface, it is encapsulated with another layer of S-VLAN tag to which the original C-VLAN-ID is mapped. Therefore, transmitted on non-edge interfaces frames are double-tagged, with the outer S-VLAN tag and inner C-VLAN tag. When a frame is sent on an edge interface the S-VLAN tag is stripped.On an edge interface C-VLANs are mapped to the S-VLANs and the original C-VLAN-ID in input frame is replaced by the S-VLAN ID to which it is mapped. Untagged frames are dropped. Symmetrical translating back to the edge interface.The following features cannot be enabled if vlan-mapping is allowed: IPv4 routing IPv6 routing Auto Smart Port Voice VLAN The switchport vlan-mapping commands cannot add a port to a S-VLAN. IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces cannot be defined on VLANs containing edge interfaces. The following Layer 2 features are not supported into VLANs containing edge interfaces: IGMP Snooping MLD Snooping DHCP Snooping IPv6 First Hop Security The following protocols cannot be enabled on edge interfaces: STP GVRP The following features are not supported on edge interfaces: Radius VLAN assignment 802.1x Guest VLAN Egress ACLs are not supported on one-to-one VLAN mapping edge ports. A destination port with the network keyword or reflector port cannot be configured on an edge port. Note. All the limitations for edge ports specified above are checked by the switchport vlan-mapping commands and by the commands configuring these features. By default the switch does not forward frames received on edge ports with the following destination MAC addresses: 01:80:C2:00:00:00-01:80:C2:00:00:FF 01:00:0C:00:00:00-01:00:0C:FF:FF:FF 01:00:0C:CD:CD:D0 Note.

The range is from 1 to 4094. translated-vlan-id \u2014Specifies B-VLAN replacing the E-VLAN. The range is from 1 to 4094. Default Configuration No VLAN mapping is configured. Command Mode Interface (Ethernet, Port Channel) Configuration mode User Guidelines Use the switchport vlan-mapping one-to-one command to configure selective one-to-one VLAN translation. The S-VLAN specified by the translated-vlan-id argument must be created before configuring of this command. If this VLAN does not exist the command fails. A few switchport vlan-mapping one-to-one commands with different arguments can be defined on the same interface. In the vlan-mapping one-to-one mode an interface belongs to all S-VLANs for which mapping on this interface is defined as egress tagged interface. The interface PVID is set to 4095. In the vlan-mapping one-to-one mode an interface uses one ingress ACL and one egress ACL. The switchport vlan-mapping one-to-one command adds rules to this ACLs. These ACLs are applied in order to: Ingress ACL (in TTI): Replace specified C-VLAN-ID by S-VLAN-ID. Drop frames with unspecified C-VLAN-IDs. Drop untagged input frames. Egress ACL (in TCAM): Replace S-VLAN-ID by C-VLAN-ID. The switchport vlan-mapping one-to-one command adds rules to these ACLs and they are bound on the interface only if its mode is vlan-mapping one-to-one. The ingress ACL contains V+1 rules and the egress ACL contains V rules, where V\u2014The number of specified C-VLANs. Use the no switchport vlan-mapping one-to-one vlan-id command to delete the one-to-one VLAN translation configuration for the given E-VLAN. Use the no switchport vlan-mapping one-to-one command to delete all VLAN one-to-one translations. Example This example shows how to configure one-to-one VLAN translation on a port:switchxxxxxx(config)  interface gi1/0/1 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  switchport vlan mapping one-to-one 5 105 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  switchport vlan mapping one-to-one 15 5 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  switchport vlan mapping one-to-one 105 225 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  exit",

If the administrative state is: disabled \u2014 The operational state is disabled. oui-enabled \u2014The operational state is oui-enabled. auto-enabled \u2014 The operational state is auto-enabled. auto-triggered \u2014 The operational state is auto-enabled only if one of the following occurs: A static local configured voice VLAN ID, CoS/802.1p, and/or DSCP that is not factory default is configured. A CDP voice VLAN advertisement is received from a neighboring CDP device that is not a a device of the same family as the current device. A Voice Service Discovery Protocol (VSDP) message was received from a neighbor switch. VSDP is a Cisco Small Business proprietary protocol for SF and SG series managed switches. In all other cases the operational state is disabled. Notes: To change the administrative state from oui-enabled to auto-enabled (or auto-triggered), or vice versa, you must first set the administrative state to disabled. The administrative state cannot be set to oui-enabled if the Auto SmartPort administrative state is enabled. The administrative state cannot be set to oui-enabled if the voice VLAN is the default VLAN (VLAN 1). For oui-enabled mode, the voice VLAN cannot be 1. Examples Example 1 \u2014The following example enables the OUI mode of Voice VLAN. The first try did not work - it was necessary to first disable voice VLAN. switchxxxxxx(config)  voice vlan state oui-enabled Disable the voice VLAN before changing the voice VLAN trigger. switchxxxxxx(config)  voice vlan state disabled switchxxxxxx(config)  voice vlan state oui-enabled <CR> Example 2 \u2014 The following example disables the Voice VLAN state.
