    "page_content": "This CLI guide provides CLI commands and guidelines for the CBS 350 Stacking and Non-Stacking switches. These product line supports 2 \"sub-types\" - the devices in the first sub-type support 10GigabitEthernet on all ports, the devices of the 2nd subtype support 10GigabitEthernet only on the uplink ports. Besides a few CLI commands, which will be mentioned below, the CLI commands included in this document can be applied to both \"subtypes\". Following are the notes and differences in CLI command support in regards to these product lines: Ports types\u2014 The \"all 10G\" port subtype support ports with TengigabitEthernet (XG) speed. The \"10G uplink\" port subtype can support different network ports type of: Gigabitethernet (GE), 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet (TW) and 5 Gigabit Ethernet (FI); In addition these devices support 4 XG uplink ports. CLI examples in this document use the GE port type in examples, but the same commands can be applied to TW, FI or XG port types, unless there is a difference in feature implementation between port types. Speed and negotiation settings\u2014Each port type supports the negotiation and speed setting relevant to the port type. For example a GE interface does not support speed or negotiation of 10G interface. OOB interface\u2014The \"all 10G\" port subtype supports an OOB interface, while the \"10G uplink port subtype does not. Therefore, OOB as a configurable interface is relevant only to the \"all 10G\" port subtype. For devices that support OOB \u2013 DHCP client and default IP address (192.168.1.254) are applied to the OOB port and not to the default VLAN. Power Over Ethernet\u2014PoE is supported on some of the \"10G uplink\" port subtype devices and not on the \"all 10G\" port subtype devices. Therefore PoE commands are relevant only to the \"10G uplink\" port subtype. Stacking\u2014On both subtypes only 10G interfaces can be defined as stacking interfaces. Short reach and energy detect\u2014Short Reach is always enabled on the \"all 10G\" port subtype devices and TW and FI ports (all SKUs); Energy Detect is always enabled on XG ports of the \"all 10G\" port subtype devices; For all other interface types- both of these features can be enabled or disabled (default is disabled). MAC address aging time\u2014The maximum value for \"all 10G\" port subtype devices is 630 seconds, while the maximum value for \"10G uplink\" port subtype devices and Hybrid mode stack is 400 seconds. The default value for both subtypes is the same \u2013 300 seconds. IPv6 tunnels\u2014IPv6 Manual, 6to4 and ISATAP routing tunnels are supported on the \"all 10G\" port subtype devices, and are not supported on \"10G uplink\" port subtype devices. System Router Resources\u2014The default values stated in command are for the \"10G uplink\" port subtype devices. The \"all 10G\" port subtype devices supports the following default values: policy-ip-entries\u201416 policy-ipv6-entries\u201416 VLAN mapping entries \u201432",

Users at this level cannot access the web GUI or commands in the Privileged EXEC mode. Level 7\u2014Users with this level can run commands in the User EXEC mode and a subset of commands in the Privileged EXEC mode. Users at this level cannot access the web GUI. Level 15\u2014Users with this level can run all commands. Only users at this level can access the web GUI. A system administrator (user with level 15) can create passwords that allow a lower level user to temporarily become a higher level user. For example, the user may go from level 1 to level 7, level 1 to 15, or level 7 to level 15. The passwords for each level are set (by an administrator) using the following command: enable password [level privilege-level]{password|encrypted encrypted-password} Using these passwords, you can raise your user level by entering the command: enable and the password for level 7 or 15. You can go from level 1 to level 7 or directly to level 15. The higher level holds only for the current session. The disable command returns the user to a lower level. To create a user and assign it a user level, use the username command. Only users with command level 15, can create users at this level. Example\u2014Create passwords for level 7 and 15 (by the administrator): switchxxxxxx configure switchxxxxxx<conf>  enable password level 7 level7@aBc switchxxxxxx<conf>  enable password level 15 level15@aBc switchxxxxxx<conf>  Create a user with user level 1: switchxxxxxx configure switchxxxxxx<conf> username john password John1234 privilege 1 switchxxxxxx<conf> Example 2\u2014 Switch between Level 1 to Level 15.

    "page_content": "The CLI is divided into four command modes. The command modes are (in the order in which they are accessed): User EXEC mode Privileged EXEC mode Global Configuration mode Each command mode has its own unique console prompt and set of CLI commands. Entering a question mark at the console prompt displays a list of available commands for the current mode and for the level of the user. Specific commands are used to switch from one mode to another. Users are assigned privilege levels that determine the modes and commands available to them. User EXEC Mode Users with level 1 initially log into User EXEC mode. User EXEC mode is used for tasks that do not change the configuration, such as performing basic tests and listing system information. The user-level prompt consists of the switch host name followed by a  . The default host name is switchxxxxxx where xxxxxx is the last six digits of the device\u2019s MAC address, as shown below switchxxxxxx  The default host name can be changed via the hostname command in Global Configuration mode. Privileged EXEC Mode A user with level 7 or 15 automatically logs into Privileged EXEC mode. Users with level 1 can enter Privileged Exec mode by entering the enable command, and when prompted, the password for level 15. To return from the Privileged EXEC mode to the User EXEC mode, use the disable command Global Configuration Mode The Global Configuration mode is used to run commands that configure features at the system level, as opposed to the interface level. Only users with command level of 7 or 15 can access this mode. To access Global Configuration mode from Privileged EXEC mode, enter the configure command at the Privileged EXEC mode prompt and press Enter. The Global Configuration mode prompt, consisting of the device host name followed by (config) , is displayed: switchxxxxxx(config)  Use any of the following commands to return from Global Configuration mode to the Privileged EXEC mode: exit end Ctrl+Z The following example shows how to access Global Configuration mode and return to Privileged EXEC mode: switchxxxxxx  switchxxxxxx  configure switchxxxxxx(config)  exit switchxxxxxx  Interface or Line Configuration Modes Various submodes may be entered from Global Configuration mode. These submodes enable performing commands on a group of interfaces or lines. For instance to perform several operations on a specific port or range of ports, you can enter the Interface Configuration mode for that interface. The following example enters Interface Configuration mode for vlan1 and then sets their speed: The exit command returns to Global Configuration mode. switchxxxxxx  switchxxxxxx  configure switchxxxxxx(config)  interface range vlan1 switchxxxxxx(config-if) speed 10 switchxxxxxx(config-if) exit switchxxxxxx(config)  The following is a sample of some of the available submodes: Interface\u2014Contains commands that configure a specific interface (port, VLAN, port channel, or tunnel) or range of interfaces. The Global Configuration mode command interface is used to enter the Interface Configuration mode. The interface Global Configuration command is used to enter this mode. Line Interface\u2014Contains commands used to configure the management connections for the console, Telnet and SSH. These include commands such as line timeout settings, etc. The line Global Configuration command is used to enter the Line Configuration command mode. VLAN Database\u2014Contains commands used to configure a VLAN as a whole. The vlan database Global Configuration mode command is used to enter the VLAN Database Interface Configuration mode. Management Access List\u2014Contains commands used to define management access-lists. The management access-list Global Configuration mode command is used to enter the Management Access List Configuration mode. MAC Access-List, IPv6 Access List, IP Access List\u2014Configures conditions required to allow traffic based on MAC addresses, IPv6 address and IPv4 address, respectively. The mac access-list, ipv6 access-list and ip access-list Global Configuration mode commands are used to enter the these configuration mode. To return from any Interface Configuration mode to the Global Configuration mode, use the exit command.",

There is an IP path such that the computer and the switch can reach each other Using HyperTerminal over the Console Interface Some of the devices in this product line support a single RJ45 console management interface, while other devices in this product line supports a dual console management interface - mini USB and an RJ45 port. The RJ45 interface provides a direct connection to a computer\u2019s serial port using a standard DB-9 null-modem or crossover cable. If Both min USB and RJ45 are connected, on the devices that support dual management interfaces, the mini USB interface has precedence Note Mini USB interface will become active a few seconds after device is turned on/rebooted After the computer and switch are connected, run a terminal application to access the CLI. The terminal emulator must be configured to databits=8 and parity=none. Click Enter twice, so that the device sets the serial port speed to match the PC's serial port speed. When the CLI appears, enter cisco at the User Name prompt and then enter cisco for the Password prompt. Note If this is the first time that you have logged on with the default username and password, the device will display a prompt to change username and Password.

    "page_content": "Entering Commands A CLI command is a series of keywords and arguments. Keywords identify a command, and arguments specify configuration parameters. For example, in the command show interfaces status Gigabitethernet 1, show, interfaces and status are keywords, Gigabitethernet is an argument that specifies the interface type, and1 specifies the port. To enter commands that require parameters, enter the required parameters after the command keyword. For example, to set a password for the administrator, enter: switchxxxxxx(config)  username admin password Alansmith1 When working with the CLI, the command options are not displayed. The standard command to request help is ? There are two instances where help information can be displayed: Keyword lookup\u2014The character ? is entered in place of a command. A list of all valid commands and corresponding help messages are is displayed Partial keyword lookup\u2014If a command is incomplete and or the character ? is entered in place of a parameter, the matched keyword or parameters for this command are displayed. Terminal Command Buffer Every time a command is entered in the CLI, it is recorded on an internally managed Command History buffer. Commands stored in the buffer are maintained on a First In First Out (FIFO) basis. These commands can be recalled, reviewed, modified, and reissued. This buffer is not preserved across device resets. Keyword Description Up-Arrow key Recalls commands in the history buffer, beginning with the most recent command. Repeat the key sequence to recall successively older commands. Down-Arrow key Returns to more recent commands in the history buffer after recalling commands with the up-arrow key. Repeating the key sequence will recall successively more recent commands. By default, the history buffer system is enabled, but it can be disabled at any time. For more information on enabling or disabling the history buffer, refer to the history command. There is a standard default number of commands that are stored in the buffer. The standard number of 10 commands can be increased to 216. By configuring 0, the effect is the same as disabling the history buffer system. For more information on configuring the command history buffer, refer to the history size command. To display the history buffer, refer to the show history command. Negating the Effect of Commands For many configuration commands, the prefix keyword no can be entered to cancel the effect of a command or reset the configuration to the default value. This Reference Guide provides a description of the negation effect for each CLI command. Command Completion If the command entered is incomplete, invalid or has missing or invalid parameters, then the appropriate error message is displayed. This assists in entering the correct command. By pressing Tab after an incomplete command is entered, the system will attempt to identify and complete the command. If the characters already entered are not enough for the system to identify a single matching command, press ? to display the available commands matching the characters already entered. Keyboard Shortcuts The CLI has a range of keyboard shortcuts to assist in editing the CLI commands. The following table describes the CLI shortcuts. Keyboard Key Description Up-arrow Recalls commands from the history buffer, beginning with the most recent command. Repeat the key sequence to recall successively older commands. Down-arrow Returns the most recent commands from the history buffer after recalling commands with the up arrow key. Repeating the key sequence will recall successively more recent commands. Ctrl+A Moves the cursor to the beginning of the command line. Ctrl+E Moves the cursor to the end of the command line. Ctrl+Z / End Returns back to the Privileged EXEC mode from any configuration mode. Backspace Deletes one character left to the cursor position. Copying and Pasting Text Up to 1000 lines of text (or commands) can be copied and pasted into the device. Note It is the user\u2019s responsibility to ensure that the text copied into the device consists of legal commands only. When copying and pasting commands from a configuration file, make sure that the following conditions exist: A device Configuration mode has been accessed. The commands contain no encrypted data, like encrypted passwords or keys. Encrypted data cannot be copied and pasted into the device except for encrypted passwords where the keyword encrypted is used before the encrypted data (for instance in the enable password command).",

It can use any IP address defined on the router, but if this link goes down, the communication is aborted, even though there might well be another IP route between these IP applications. The loopback interface is a virtual interface whose operational state is always up. If the IP address that is configured on this virtual interface is used as the local address when communicating with remote IP applications, the communication will not be aborted even if the actual route to the remote application was changed. The name of the loopback interface is loopback1. A loopback interface does not support bridging; it cannot be a member of any VLAN, and no layer 2 protocol can be enabled on it. Layer 3 Specification IP Interface IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be assigned to a loopback interface. The IPv6 link-local interface identifier is 1. Routing Protocols A routing protocol running on the switch supports the advertising of the IP prefixes defined on the loopback interfaces via the routing protocol redistribution mechanism.

Fiber cable and Transceivers Cisco brand provides a panoply a SFP modules, while our switches support other 3rd party, it is important to pay attention on the type of fiber cable to use in conjunction with the specific SFP module. Fiber cables can be classified in two types: Single Mode and Multimode. The main difference is the distance they are capable of covering and their diameter. Single Mode fibers cover greater distance compared to Multimode and has lower diameter (around 9 micrometer) while the Multimode fibers diameter is 50-62.5 micrometer. DAC cables for Direct Attach Copper Cable, on the other hand, can be used for short distances. They are mainly based on the Multimode-Standard type of transceivers due to the fact that the max distance they can cover is 15m. The AOC (Active Optical Cable), however, is a different story. When troubleshooting fiber connectivity related issues, it is important to make a distinction between SMF (Single Mode Fiber cables), and MMF (Multimode Fiber cables) and their corresponding SFP transceivers a given fiber can support. Cisco has matrix that we can refer to when trying to make a determination of the correct pairing. The following link provide some insight on Cisco 10gig SFP Example: The Cisco SFP-10G-SR only works with MMF type of cable of 62.5 micrometer diameter, while the Cisco SFP-10G-LR works only with SMF type of cable. The MMF range from OM1-OM5. OM is for Optical Multimode. OM1 type cables have a diameter of 62.5 micrometer, while all other types (OM2-OM5) have a diameter of 50 micrometer. So, it is important to know what is being done to avoid mixing them up.",

Note Only 1 output modifier can be used in each command. The remainder of the text typed in is part of the regular expression pattern. A regular expression is a pattern (a phrase, number, or more complex pattern). The CLI String Search feature matches regular expressions to the show or more command output. Regular expressions are case-sensitive and allow for complex matching requirements. A regular expression can be a single-character pattern or a multiple-character pattern. That is, a regular expression can be a single character that matches the same single character in the command output or multiple characters that match the same multiple characters in the command output. The pattern in the command output is referred to as a string. This section describes creating both single-character patterns and multiple-character patterns. It also discusses creating more complex regular expressions, using multipliers, alternation, anchoring, and parentheses. Single-Character Patterns The simplest regular expression is a single character that matches the same single character in the command output. You can use any letter (A-Z, a-z) or digit (0-9) as a single-character pattern. You can also use other keyboard characters (such as ! or ~) as single-character patterns, but certain keyboard characters have special meaning when used in regular expressions. The following table lists the keyboard characters that have special meanings Character Meaning . Matches any single character, including white space. * Matches 0 or more sequences of the pattern. + Matches 1 or more sequences of the pattern. ? Matches 0 or 1 occurrences of the pattern. ^ Matches the beginning of the string. $ Matches the end of the string. To use these special characters as single-character patterns, remove the special meaning by preceding each character with a backslash (). The following examples are single-character patterns matching a dollar sign, an underscore, and a plus sign, respectively. $ _ + You can specify a range of single-character patterns to match against command output. For example, you can create a regular expression that matches a string containing one of the following letters: a, e, i, o, or u. Only one of these characters must exist in the string for pattern matching to succeed. To specify a range of single-character patterns, enclose the single-character patterns in square brackets ([ ]). For example, [aeiou] matches any one of the five vowels of the lowercase alphabet, while [abcdABCD] matches any one of the first four letters of the lower- or uppercase alphabet. You can simplify ranges by entering only the endpoints of the range separated by a dash (-). Simplify the previous range as follows: [a-dA-D] To add a dash as a single-character pattern in your range, include another dash and precede it with a backslash: [a-dA-D-] You can also include a right square bracket (]) as a single-character pattern in your range, as shown here: [a-dA-D-] The previous example matches any one of the first four letters of the lower- or uppercase alphabet, a dash, or a right square bracket. You can reverse the matching of the range by including a caret (^) at the start of the range. The following example matches any letter except the ones listed: [^a-dqsv] The following example matches anything except a right square bracket (]) or the letter d: [^]d] Multiple-Character Patterns When creating regular expressions, you can also specify a pattern containing multiple characters. You create multiple-character regular expressions by joining letters, digits, or keyboard characters that do not have special meaning. For example, a4% is a multiple-character regular expression. With multiple-character patterns, order is important. The regular expression a4% matches the character a followed by a 4 followed by a % sign. If the string does not have a4%, in that order, pattern matching fails. The multiple-character regular expression a. uses the special meaning of the period character to match the letter a followed by any single character. With this example, the strings ab, a!, or a2 are all valid matches for the regular expression. You can remove the special meaning of the period character by inserting a backslash before it. For example, when the expression a. is used in the command syntax, only the string a. will be matched. You can create a multiple-character regular expression containing all letters, all digits, all keyboard characters, or a combination of letters, digits, and other keyboard characters. For example, telebit 3107 v32bis is a valid regular expression. Multipliers You can create more complex regular expressions that instruct the system to match multiple occurrences of a specified regular expression. To do so, use some special characters with your single-character and multiple-character patterns. Table 1 lists the special characters that specify multiples of a regular expression. Table 1. Table 1: Special Characters Used as Multipliers Character Description * Matches 0 or more single-character or multiple-character patterns. + Matches 1 or more single-character or multiple-character patterns. ? Matches 0 or 1 occurrences of a single-character or multiple-character pattern. The following example matches any number of occurrences of the letter a, including none: a* The following pattern requires that at least one letter a be in the string to be matched: a+ The following pattern matches the string bb or bab: ba?b The following string matches any number of asterisks (*): * To use multipliers with multiple-character patterns, enclose the pattern in parentheses. In the following example, the pattern matches any number of the multiple-character string ab: (ab)* The following pattern matches one or more instances of alphanumeric pairs, but not none (that is, an empty string is not a match): ([A-Za-z][0-9])+ The order for matches using multipliers (*, +, or ?) is to put the longest construct first. Nested constructs are matched from outside to inside. Concatenated constructs are matched beginning at the left side of the construct. Thus, the regular expression above matches A9b3, but not 9Ab3 because the letters are specified before the numbers. Alternation Alternation allows you to specify alternative patterns to match against a string. You separate the alternative patterns with a vertical bar (|). Only one of the alternatives can match the string. For example, the regular expression codex|telebit either matches the string codex or the string telebit, but not both codex and telebit. Anchoring You can instruct the system to match a regular expression pattern against the beginning or the end of the string. You anchor these regular expressions to a portion of the string using the special characters shown in Table 2. Table 2. Table 2: Special Characters Used for Anchoring Character Description ^ Matches the beginning of the string. $ Matches the end of the string. For example, the regular expression ^con matches any string that starts with con, and $sole matches any string that ends with sole. In addition to indicating the beginning of a string, the ^ symbol can be used to indicate the logical function not when used in a bracketed range. For example, the expression [^abcd] indicates a range that matches any single letter, as long as it is not the letters a, b, c, or d.",

    "page_content": "To allow a single host (client) or multiple hosts on an IEEE 802.1X-authorized port, use the dot1x host-mode command in Interface Configuration mode. To restore the default configuration, use the no form of this command. Syntax dot1x host-mode {multi-host | single-host | multi-sessions} Parameters multi-host\u2014Enable multiple-hosts mode. single-host\u2014Enable single-hosts mode. multi-sessions\u2014Enable multiple-sessions mode. Default Configuration Default mode is multi-host. Command Mode Interface (Ethernet) Configuration mode User Guidelines Single-Host Mode The single-host mode manages the authentication status of the port: the port is authorized if there is an authorized host. In this mode, only a single host can be authorized on the port. When a port is unauthorized and the guest VLAN is enabled, untagged traffic is remapped to the guest VLAN. Tagged traffic is dropped unless the VLAN tag is the guest VLAN or the unauthenticated VLANs. If guest VLAN is not enabled on the port, only tagged traffic belonging to the unauthenticated VLANs is bridged. When a port is authorized, untagged and tagged traffic from the authorized host is bridged based on the static vlan membership configured at the port. Traffic from other hosts is dropped. A user can specify that untagged traffic from the authorized host will be remapped to a VLAN that is assigned by a RADIUS server during the authentication process. In this case, tagged traffic is dropped unless the VLAN tag is the RADIUS-assigned VLAN or the unauthenticated VLANs. The switch removes from FDB all MAC addresses learned on a port when its authentication status is changed from authorized to unauthorized. Multi-Host Mode The multi-host mode manages the authentication status of the port: the port is authorized after at least one host is authorized. When a port is unauthorized and the guest VLAN is enabled, untagged traffic is remapped to the guest VLAN. Tagged traffic is dropped unless the VLAN tag is the guest VLAN or the unauthenticated VLANs. If guest VLAN is not enabled on the port, only tagged traffic belonging to the unauthenticated VLANs is bridged. When a port is authorized, untagged and tagged traffic from all hosts connected to the port is bridged based on the static vlan membership configured at the port. A user can specify that untagged traffic from the authorized port will be remapped to a VLAN that is assigned by a RADIUS server during the authentication process. In this case, tagged traffic is dropped unless the VLAN tag is the RADIUS assigned VLAN or the unauthenticated VLANs. The switch removes from FDB all MAC addresses learned on a port when its authentication status is changed from authorized to unauthorized. Multi-Sessions Mode Unlike the single-host and multi-host modes (port-based modes) the multi-sessions mode manages the authentication status for each host connected to the port (session-based mode). If the multi-sessions mode is configured on a port the port does have any authentication status. Any number of hosts can be authorized on the port. The command can limit the maximum number of authorized hosts allowed on the port. Each authorized client requires a TCAM rule. If there is no available space in the TCAM, the authentication is rejected. When using the dot1x host-mode command to change the port mode to single-host or multi-host when authentication is enabled, the port state is set to unauthorized. If the dot1x host-mode command changes the port mode to multi-session when authentication is enabled, the state of all attached hosts is set to unauthorized. To change the port mode to single-host or multi-host, set the port (dot1x port-control) to force-unauthorized, change the port mode to single-host or multi-host, and set the port to authorization auto. Tagged traffic belonging to the unauthenticated VLANs is always bridged regardless if a host is authorized or not. When the guest VLAN is enabled, untagged and tagged traffic from unauthorized hosts not belonging to the unauthenticated VLANs is bridged via the guest VLAN. Traffic from an authorized hosts is bridged in accordance with the port static configuration. A user can specify that untagged and tagged traffic from the authorized host not belonging to the unauthenticated VLANs will be remapped to a VLAN that is assigned by a RADIUS server during the authentication process. The switch does not remove from FDB the host MAC address learned on the port when its authentication status is changed from authorized to unauthorized. The MAC address will be removed after the aging timeout expires. 802.1x enabled on a port associated with a port channel has the following limitations: Only the 802.1X-based authentication is supported. Only the multi-host (legacy 802.1x mode) mode is supported. Exampleswitchxxxxxx(config)  interface gi1/0/1 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  dot1x host-mode multi-host",

If the parameter is omitted, this option is applied by default. static\u2014If the RADIUS server authorized the supplicant, but did not provide a supplicant VLAN, the supplicant is accepted. Default Configuration reject Command Mode Interface (Ethernet) Configuration mode User Guidelines If RADIUS provides invalid VLAN information, the authentication is rejected. If a RADIUS server assigns a client with a non-existing VLAN, the switch creates the VLAN. The VLAN is removed when it is no longer being used. If RADIUS provides valid VLAN information and the port does not belong to the VLAN received from RADIUS, it is added to the VLAN as an egress untagged port. When the last authorized client assigned to the VLAN becomes unauthorized or 802.1x is disabled on the port, the port is excluded from the VLAN. If the authentication mode is single-host or multi-host, the value of PVID is set to the VLAN_ID. If an authorized port in the single-host or multi-host mode changes its status to unauthorized, the port static configuration is reset. If the authentication mode is multi-sessions mode, the PVID is not changed and all untagged traffic and tagged traffic not belonging to the unauthenticated VLANs are mapped to the VLAN using TCAM. If the last authorized host assigned to a VLAN received from RADIUS connected to a port in the multi-sessions mode changes its status to unauthorized, the port is removed from the VLAN if it is not in the static configuration. See the User Guidelines of the dot1x host-mode command for more information. If 802.1X is disabled the port static configuration is reset. If the reject keyword is configured and the RADIUS server authorizes the host but the RADIUS accept message does not assign a VLAN to the supplicant, authentication is rejected. If the static keyword is configured and the RADIUS server authorizes the host then even though the RADIUS accept message does not assign a VLAN to the supplicant, authentication is accepted and the traffic from the host is bridged in accordance with port static configuration. If this command is used when there are authorized ports/hosts, it takes effect at subsequent authentications. To manually re-authenticate, use the dot1x re-authenticate command. Examples Example 1.

Predefined port names are defined in the destination-port parameter. (Range: 0\u201365535) match-all list-of-flags\u2014List of TCP flags that should occur. If a flag should be set, it is prefixed by \u201c+\u201d. If a flag should be unset, it is prefixed by \u201c-\u201d. Available options are +urg, +ack, +psh, +rst, +syn, +fin, -urg, -ack, -psh, -rst, -syn and -fin. The flags are concatenated to a one string. For example: +fin-ack. time-range-name\u2014Name of the time range that applies to this permit statement. (Range: 1\u201332) log-input\u2014Specifies sending an informational SYSLOG message about the packet that matches the entry. Because forwarding/dropping is done in hardware and logging is done in software, if a large number of packets match an ACE containing a log-input keyword, the software might not be able to match the hardware processing rate, and not all packets will be logged. Default Configuration No IPv4 access list is defined. Command Mode IP Access-list Configuration mode User Guidelines If a range of ports is used for source port in an ACE, it is not counted again, if it is also used for a source port in another ACE. If a range of ports is used for the destination port in an ACE, it is not counted again if it is also used for destination port in another ACE. If a range of ports is used for source port it is counted again if it is also used for destination port. If ace-priority is omitted, the system sets the rule's priority to the current highest priority ACE (in the current ACL) + 20. The ACE-priority must be unique per ACL.If the user types already existed priority, then the command is rejected.

(Range: 0\u201365535) source-port\u2014Specifies the UDP/TCP source port. Predefined port names are defined in the destination-port parameter. (Range: 0\u201365535) match-all list-of-flags\u2014List of TCP flags that should occur. If a flag should be set it is prefixed by \u201c+\u201d.If a flag should be unset it is prefixed by \u201c-\u201d. Available options are +urg, +ack, +psh, +rst, +syn, +fin, -urg, -ack, -psh, -rst, -syn and -fin. The flags are concatenated to a one string. For example: +fin-ack. time-range-name\u2014Name of the time range that applies to this permit statement. (Range: 1\u201332) disable-port\u2014The Ethernet interface is disabled if the condition is matched. log-input\u2014Specifies sending an informational syslog message about the packet that matches the entry. Because forwarding/dropping is done in hardware and logging is done in software, if a large number of packets match an ACE containing a log-input keyword, the software might not be able to match the hardware processing rate, and not all packets will be logged. Default Configuration No IPv4 access list is defined. Command Mode IP Access-list Configuration mode User Guidelines The number of TCP/UDP ranges that can be defined in ACLs is limited. If a range of ports is used for a source port in ACE it is not counted again if it is also used for source port in another ACE. If a range of ports is used for destination port in ACE it is not counted again if it is also used for destination port in another ACE. If a range of ports is used for source port, it is counted again if it is also used for destination port. If ace-priority is omitted, the system sets the rule's priority to the current highest priority ACE (in the current ACL) + 20. The ACE-priority must be unique per ACL.If the user types already existed priority, then the command is rejected.

Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines IPv6 ACL is defined by a unique name. IPv4 ACL, IPv6 ACL, MAC ACL or policy maps cannot have the same name. Every IPv6 ACL has an implicit permit icmp any any nd-ns any, permit icmp any any nd-na any, and deny ipv6 any any statements as its last match conditions. (The former two match conditions allow for ICMPv6 neighbor discovery.) The IPv6 neighbor discovery process uses the IPv6 network layer service, therefore, by default, IPv6 ACLs implicitly allow IPv6 neighbor discovery packets to be sent and received on an interface. In IPv4, the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), which is equivalent to the IPv6 neighbor discovery process, uses a separate data link layer protocol; therefore, by default, IPv4 ACLs implicitly allow ARP packets to be sent and received on an interface.

Default Configuration No ACL is assigned. Default action for ACL is deny-any. Command Mode Interface Configuration mode (Ethernet, Port-Channel,VLAN ) User Guidelines The following rules govern when ACLs can be bound or unbound from an interface: IPv4 ACLs and IPv6 ACLs can be bound together to an interface. A MAC ACL cannot be bound on an interface which already has an IPv4 ACL or IPv6 ACL bound to it. Two ACLs of the same type cannot be bound to a port. An ACL cannot be bound to a port that is already bound to an ACL, without first removing the current ACL. Both ACLs must be mentioned at the same time in this command. MAC ACLs that include a VLAN as match criteria cannot be bound to a VLAN. ACLs with time-based configuration on one of its ACEs cannot be bound to a VLAN. ACLs with the action Shutdown cannot be bound to a VLAN. When the user binds ACL to an interface, TCAM resources will be consumed. One TCAM rule for each MAC or IP ACE and two TCAM rules for each IPv6 ACE.The TCAM consumption is always even number, so in case of odd number of rules the consumption will be increased by 1. An ACL cannot be bound as input if it has been bound as output.

Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines Use the ip access-list command to configure IP address filtering. Access lists are configured with permit or deny keywords to either permit or deny an IP address based on a matching condition. An implicit deny is applied to address that does not match any access-list entry. An access-list entry consists of an IP address and a bit mask. The bit mask is a number from 1 to 32. Evaluation of an IP address by an access list starts with the first entry of the list and continues down the list until a match is found. When the IP address match is found, the permit or deny statement is applied to that address and the remainder of the list is not evaluated. Use the no ip access-list command to delete the access list. The IPv4 standard access list is used to filter received and sent IPv4 routing information. Examples Example 1 - The following example of a standard access list allows only the three specified networks. Any IP address that does not match the access list statements will be rejected. switchxxxxxx(config)  ip access-list 1 permit 192.168.34.0/24 switchxxxxxx(config)  ip access-list 1 permit 10.88.0.0/16 switchxxxxxx(config)  ip access-list 1 permit 10.0.0.0/8 Note: all other access is implicitly denied. Example 2 - The following example of a standard access list allows access for IP addresses in the range from 10.29.2.64 to 10.29.2.127. All IP addresses not in this range will be rejected. switchxxxxxx(config)  ip access-list apo permit 10.29.2.64/26 Note: all other access is implicitly denied. Example 3 - To specify a large number of individual addresses more easily, you can omit the mask length if it is 32. Thus, the following two configuration commands are identical in effect: switchxxxxxx(config)  ip access-list 2aa permit 10.48.0.3 switchxxxxxx(config)  ip access-list 2aa permit 10.48.0.3/32",

Default Configuration no access list Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines Use the ipv6 access-list command to configure IPv6 address filtering. Access lists are configured with permit or deny keywords to either permit or deny an IPv6 address based on a matching condition. An implicit deny is applied to address that does not match any access-list entry. An access-list entry consists of an IP address and a bit mask. The bit mask is a number from 1 to 128. Evaluation of an IPv6 address by an access list starts with the first entry of the list and continues down the list until a match is found. When the IPv6 address match is found, the permit or deny statement is applied to that address and the remainder of the list is not evaluated. Use the no ipv6 access-list command to delete the access list. The IPv6 standard access list is used to filter received and sent IPv6 routing information. Example The following example of an access list allows only the one specified prefix: Any IPv6 address that does not match the access list statements will be rejected. switchxxxxxx(config)  ipv6 access-list 1 permit 3001:2/64Note: all other access implicitly denied.",

To disable port security learning mode on an interface, use the no form of this command. Syntax port security [forward | discard | discard-shutdown] [trap seconds] no port security Parameters forward\u2014(Optional) Forwards packets with unlearned source addresses, but does not learn the address. discard\u2014(Optional) Discards packets with unlearned source addresses. discard-shutdown\u2014(Optional) Discards packets with unlearned source addresses and shuts down the port. trap seconds\u2014(Optional) Sends SNMP traps and specifies the minimum time interval in seconds between consecutive traps. (Range: 1\u20131000000) Default Configuration The feature is disabled by default. The default mode is discard. The default number of seconds is zero, but if traps is entered, a number of seconds must also be entered. Command Mode Interface (Ethernet, Port Channel) Configuration mode User Guidelines The command may be used only when the interface in the regular (non-secure with unlimited MAC learning) mode. Port Security cannot be enabled on an interface if 802.1X authentication is already active on the interface. When the port security command enables the lock mode on a port all dynamic addresses learned on the port are changed to permanent secure addresses. When the port security command enables a mode on a port differing from the lock mode all dynamic addresses learned on the port are deleted. When the no port security command cancels a secure mode on a port all secure addresses defined on the port are changed to dynamic addresses. Additionally to set a mode, use the port security command to set an action that the switch should perform on a frame which source MAC address cannot be learned. Example The following example forwards all packets to port gi1/0/1 without learning addresses of packets from unknown sources and sends traps every 100 seconds, if a packet with an unknown source address is received. switchxxxxxx(config)  interface gi1/0/4 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  port security mode lock switchxxxxxx(config-if)  port security forward trap 100 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  exit",

For devices that do not support console - the quiet-mode access-class has no default. Command Mode Global configuration mode. User Guidelines Use the login quiet-mode access-class command to allow selective hosts access to the device management during a login quiet period. Access is allowed based on the specified Management ACL. The management access list needs to be created prior to configuring this command using the management access-list command. This settings provides the ability to grant access to a client or list of clients even during a quiet-mode period. On devices that support a console connection the \"console-only\" management access-list is applied by default during a quiet-mode period, meaning all network login connections (telnet, SSH, SNMP, HTTP, HTTPS) are denied, while a connection from the console is allowed. On devices that do not support a console there is no default access-class and the login block-for command cannot be configured if user did not first define a quiet-mode access-class. The command is rejected if it is configured during a quiet-mode period. The no form of the command returns quiet-mode access-class to the default setting. On devices without a console the no command cannot be applied if login block-for command is configured.

Character Repetition: A character cannot be repeated consecutively. The maximum number of repetition allowed is 3 by default. Minimum number of character classes: The number of different character classes that must be included in the password (classes are: uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number and special character). The minimum number is 3 by default and is configurable to 0-4 (0 and 1 are functionally identical).

For example, C!$c0678! is not permitted. Known passwords are not allowed as passwords. When the administrator configures a new enable password, this password is encrypted automatically and saved to the configuration file. No matter how the password was entered, it appears in the configuration file with the keyword encrypted and the encrypted value. The administrator is required to use the encrypted keyword only when actually entering an encrypted keyword. If the administrator wants to manually copy a password that was configured on one switch (for instance, switch B) to another switch (for instance, switch A), the administrator must add encrypted in front of this encrypted password when entering the enable command in switch A. In this way, the two switches will have the same password. The administrator is required to use the encrypted keyword only when actually entering an encrypted keyword.

The range is from 1 to 160 characters. owner\u2014specifies the owner of the certificate. This is a string of 0 to 32 characters. If an owner is not specified, the default owner is \"Static\". When adding a certificate, the certificate itself should follow the command on the command line. Default Configuration There are no installed certificates. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines Use the ca-certificate install name command to install a CA certificate. Following the command, the user will be prompted to enter the certificate in the command line. The user will need to enter or paste the certificate. Entering a period on a separate line indicates that the certificate input is complete. The entered certificate must use the pem format. A certificate will not be valid if the system clock was not set by user or synchronized with SNTP, or based on hardware based Real Time Clock (RTC). Up to 256 certificates can be installed. When using the no form of the command to remove certificates, a specific certificate can be removed by name.

Capabilities\u2014The device type of the neighbor. This device can be a router, a bridge, a transparent bridge, a source-routing bridge, a switch, a host, an IGMP device, or a repeater. COS for Untrusted Ports\u2014The COS value with which all packets received on an untrusted port should be marked by a simple switching device which cannot itself classify individual packets. Device ID\u2014The name of the neighbor device and either the MAC address or the serial number of this device. Duplex\u2014The duplex state of connection between the current device and the neighbor device. Entry address(es)\u2014A list of network addresses of neighbor devices. Extended Trust\u2014The Extended Trust. External Port-ID\u2014Identifies the physical connector port on which the CDP packet is transmitted. It is used in devices, such as those with optical ports, in which signals from multiple hardware interfaces are multiplexed through a single physical port. It contains the name of the external physical port through which the multiplexed signal is transmitted. Interface\u2014The protocol and port number of the port on the current device. IP Network Prefix\u2014It is used by On Demand Routing (ODR). When transmitted by a hub router, it is a default route (an IP address). When transmitted by a stub router, it is a list of network prefixes of stub networks to which the sending stub router can forward IP packets. Management Address\u2014When present, it contains a list of all the addresses at which the device will accept SNMP messages, including those it will only accept when received on interface(s) other than the one over which the CDP packet is being sent. MTU\u2014The MTU of the interface via which the CDP packet is sent. Native VLAN\u2014The ID number of the VLAN on the neighbor device. Physical Location\u2014A character string indicating the physical location of a connector which is on, or physically connected to, the interface over which the CDP packet containing this TLV is sent. Platform\u2014The product name and number of the neighbor device. In the case of the Secondary Cache only the 8 last characters of the value are printed. Power Available\u2014Every switch interface transmits information in the Power Available TLV, which permits a device which needs power to negotiate and select an appropriate power setting. The Power Available TLV includes four fields. Power Consumption\u2014The maximum amount of power, in milliwatts, expected to be obtained and consumed from the interface over which the CDP packet is sent. Power Drawn\u2014The maximum requested power. Note: For IP Phones the value shown is the maximum requested power (6.3 Watts). This value can be different than the actual power supplied by the routing device (generally 5 watts; shown using the show power command). Protocol-Hello\u2014Specifies that a particular protocol has asked CDP to piggyback its \"hello\" messages within transmitted CDP packets. Remote Port_ID\u2014Identifies the port the CDP packet is sent on sysName\u2014An ASCII string containing the same value as the sending device's sysName MIB object. sysObjectID\u2014The OBJECT-IDENTIFIER value of the sending device's sysObjectID MIB object. Time To Live\u2014The remaining amount of time, in seconds, the current device will hold the CDP advertisement from a transmitting router before discarding it. Version\u2014The software version running on the neighbor device. Voice VLAN-ID\u2014The Voice VLAN-ID. VTP Management Domain\u2014A string that is the name of the collective group of VLANs associated with the neighbor device.",

(Range: 199\u20131000) any | ip-address\u2014Specifies the destination IP address. Use any to specify all IP addresses. mask\u2014Specifies the network mask of the destination IP address. prefix-length\u2014Specifies the number of bits that comprise the destination IP address prefix.

If ip-address is unspecified, the default is 255.255.255.255 If prefix-length is unspecified, the default is 32. Command Mode Interface (Ethernet, Port Channel) Configuration mode User Guidelines For this command to work, show security-suite configuration must be enabled both globally and for interfaces. This command rate limits ingress TCP packets with \"SYN=1\", \"ACK=0\" and \"FIN=0\" for the specified destination IP addresses. SYN attack rate limiting is implemented after the security suite rules are applied to the packets. The ACL and QoS rules are not applied to those packets. Since the hardware rate limiting counts bytes, it is assumed that the size of \u201cSYN\u201d packets is short. Example The following example attempts to rate limit DoS SYN attacks on a port. It fails because security suite is enabled globally and not per interface. switchxxxxxx(config)  security-suite enable global-rules-only switchxxxxxx(config)  interface gi1/0/1 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  security-suite dos syn-attack 199 any /10 To perform this command, DoS Prevention must be enabled in the per-interface mode.",

Resources are released when the no security-suite enable command is entered. MAC ACLs must be removed before the security-suite is enabled. The rules can be re-entered after the security-suite is enabled. If ACLs or policy maps are assigned on interfaces, per interface security-suite rules cannot be enabled.

Tokens must be entered in the exact format specified (see table below) or it will not be recognized as a token The text can begin or end with free text or a token. Tokens can be concatenated sequentially or separated by free text. If the free text includes a space character - the text parameter must be placed between quotation (e.g. \"text1 text2\"). The Circuit-ID payload template must include at least 1 token related to an interface parameter (token beginning with $int-xxx$). In addition - if the string does not include a VLAN related token - user will be asked to confirm setting. The total length of the text field in the command cannot exceed 160 bytes. The byte count includes all bytes of the text parameter - including all free text and Tokens as written in the text field. The combined length of the Circuit-ID payload Remote-ID payload cannot exceed 247 bytes.

A new definition of an option overrides the previous definition of this option. The boolean keyword may be configured for the following options: 19, 20, 27, 29-31, 34, 36, and 39. The integer keyword may be configured for the following options: 2, 13, 22-26, 35, 37-38, 132-134, and 211. The switch checks the value range and builds the value field of the size in accordance with the option definition. The ascii keyword may be configured for the following options: 14, 17-18, 40, 64, 130, 209, and 210. The ip keyword may be configured for the following options: 16, 28, 32, 128-129, 131, 135, and 136.

Default Configuration There is no globally-defined relay destination. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines The ipv6 dhcp relay destination command specifies a destination address to which client messages are forwarded. The address is used by all DHCPv6 relays running on the switch. Up to 100 addresses can be defined. When a relay service is running on an interface, a DHCP for IPv6 message received on that interface will be forwarded to all configured relay destinations configured per interface and globally. Multiple destinations can be configured on one interface, and multiple output interfaces can be configured for one destination. Unspecified, loopback, and Multicast addresses are not acceptable as the relay destination. Use the no form of the command with the ipv6-address and interface-id arguments to remove only the given globally-defined address with the given output interface. Use the no form of the command with the ipv6-address argument to remove only the given globally-defined address for all output interfaces. The no form of the command without the arguments removes all the globally-defined addresses. Examples Example 1. The following example sets the relay unicast link-local destination address per VLAN 200: switchxxxxxx(config)  ipv6 dhcp relay destination FE80:1:2 vlan 200 Example 2. The following example sets that client messages are forwarded to VLAN 200: switchxxxxxx(config)  ipv6 dhcp relay destination vlan 200 Example 3. The following example sets the unicast global relay destination address: switchxxxxxx(config)  ipv6 dhcp relay destination 3002:1:2",

If this argument is configured, client messages are forwarded to the well-known link-local Multicast address All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers (FF02:1:2) through the link to which the output interface is connected. Default Configuration The relay function is disabled, and there is no relay destination on an interface. Command Mode Interface Configuration mode User Guidelines This command specifies a destination address to which client messages are forwarded, and it enables DHCP for IPv6 relay service on the interface. Up to 10 addresses can be defined per one interface and up to 100 addresses can be defined per switch. DHCPv6 Relay inserts the Interface-id option if an IPv6 global address is not defined on the interface on which the relay is running. The Interface-id field of the option is the interface name (a value of the ifName field of the ifTable) on which the relay is running. When relay service is running on an interface, a DHCP for IPv6 message received on that interface will be forwarded to all configured relay destinations configured per interface and globally. The incoming DHCP for IPv6 message may have come from a client on that interface, or it may have been relayed by another relay agent. The relay destination can be a Unicast address of a server or another relay agent, or it may be a Multicast address. There are two types of relay destination addresses: A link-local Unicast or Multicast IPv6 address, for which a user must specify an output interface A global Unicast IPv6 address. A user can optionally specify an output interface for this kind of address. If no output interface is configured for a destination, the output interface is determined by routing tables. In this case, it is recommended that a Unicast or Multicast routing protocol be running on the router. Multiple destinations can be configured on one interface, and multiple output interfaces can be configured for one destination. When the relay agent relays messages to a Multicast address, it sets the hop limit field in the IPv6 packet header to 32. Unspecified, loopback, and node-local Multicast addresses are not acceptable as the relay destination. Note that it is not necessary to enable the relay function on an interface for it to accept and forward an incoming relay reply message from servers. By default, the relay function is disabled, and there is no relay destination on an interface. Use the no form of the command with arguments to remove a specific address. Use the no form of the command without arguments to remove all the defined addresses and to disable the relay on the interface. Examples Example 1. The following example sets the relay Unicast link-local destination address per VLAN 200 and enables the DHCPv6 Relay on VLAN 100 if it was not enabled: switchxxxxxx(config)  interface vlan 100 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  ipv6 dhcp relay destination FE80:1:2 vlan 200 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  exitExample 2. The following example sets the relay well known Multicast link-local destination address per VLAN 200 and enables the DHCPv6 Relay on VLAN 100 if it was not enabled: switchxxxxxx(config)  interface vlan 100 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  ipv6 dhcp relay destination vlan 200 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  exitExample 3.

The following example enables DHCPv6 relay on VLAN 100: switchxxxxxx(config)  interface vlan 100 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  ipv6 dhcp relay destination switchxxxxxx(config-if)  exitExample 5.

The predefined URL aliases can be configured. dst-url\u2014The URL of the destination file or the directory to be copied. The predefined URL aliases cannot be configured. exclude\u2014The file does not include sensitive data in the file being copied. include-encrypted\u2014The file includes sensitive data in its encrypted form. This secure option is applied by default, if no secure option is configured. include-plaintext\u2014The file includes sensitive data in its plaintext form. tech-support cbd \u2014 Indicates that the source is the Cisco Business Dashboard (CBD) tech support information. If this source is selected, the destination can only be USB. If specified filename does not include the \".zip\" suffix, this suffix will be added automatically to copied filename (full path length up to 160 characters). Command Mode Privileged EXEC mode User Guidelines The following guidelines are relevant: You cannot copy one network file to another network file. Localization is not supported as a predefined src-url or dst-url. Use the copy src-url dst-url command to copy any file. If the dst-url argument defines an existed flash file the command fails if this file does not have the writable permission. If the dst-url argument defines a directory file then the file is copied into the directory with the same name. No file format validation or conversion is performed. If the src-url argument and dst-url arguments define flash files the dst-url file will have the permissions of the src-url file. If the src-url argument defines a non-flash file and the dst-url argument defines a flash files the dst-url file will have the following permissions: readable writable Use the copy src-url running-config command to add a file to the Running Configuration file. Examples Example 1. The following example copies file file1 from the TFTP server 172.16.101.101 to the flash:/aaa/file1 file: switchxxxxxx  copy tftp:/172.16.101.101/file1 flash:/aaa/file1 Example 2.

The following example copies the Running Configuration file to the Startup configuration: switchxxxxxx  copy running-config startup-config Note * If ssd configuration in show running-config or startup-config reads \u201cfile SSD indicator plaintext\u201d, the copied file will have sensitive information in plaintext. If ssd configuration in show running-config or startup-config reads \u201cfile SSD indicator encrypted \u201d, the copied file will have sensitive information encrypted. If ssd configuration in show running-config or startup-config reads \u201cfile SSD indicator exclude \u201d, the copied file will not include sensitive information will be excluded. Example 4. The following example copies the Syslog file to a TFTP server: switchxxxxxx  copy logging tftp:/1.1.1.1/syslog.txt Example 5. The following example copies a file from the mass-storage device connected to the USB port to Flash: switchxxxxxx  copy usb:/aaa/file1.txt flash:/dir1/file2",

If the IGMP Querier election mechanism is enabled, the IGMP Snooping querier supports the standard IGMP Querier election mechanism specified in RFC2236 and RFC3376. If IGMP Querier election mechanism is disabled, IGMP Snooping Querier delays sending General Query messages for 60 seconds from the time it was enabled. During this time, if the switch did not receive an IGMP query from another Querier - it starts sending General Query messages. Once the switch acts as a Querier, it will stop sending General Query messages if it detects another Querier on the VLAN. In this case, the switch will resume sending General Query messages if it does hear another Querier for Query Passive interval that equals to <Robustness>*<Query Interval> + 0.5*<Query Response Interval). It is recommended to disable IGMP Querier election mechanism if there is an IPM Multicast router on the VLAN.

The route is gotten a metric of 4 for an In-Band interface and 2 for OOB. Default Configuration No IP address is defined for interfaces. Command Mode Interface Configuration mode User Guidelines Use the ip address command to define a static IP address on an interface. In-Band interfaces Multiple IP addresses are supported. A new defined IP address is added on the interface. Defining a static IP address on an interface stops a DHCP client running on the interface and removes the IP address assigned by the DHCP client. If a configured IP address overlaps another configured one a warning message is displayed. To change an existed IP address, delete the existed one and add the new one. While no IP address is assigned either by DHCP client or manually the default IP address 192.168.1.254 is assigned on the Default VLAN. OOB port One IP address is supported. A new IP address defined on the OOB port overrides the previously defined IP address on the OOB port. Defining a static IP address on the OOB port stops a DHCP client running on the OOB port and deletes an IP address assigned by the DHCP client. While no IP address is assigned either by DHCP client or manually the default IP address 192.168.1.254 is assigned on the OOB port Examples Example 1.

Syntax ip helper-address {ip-interface | all} address [udp-port-list] no ip helper-address {ip-interface | all} address Parameters ip-interface\u2014Specifies the IP interface. all\u2014Specifies all IP interfaces. address\u2014Specifies the destination broadcast or host address to which to forward UDP broadcast packets. A value of 0.0.0.0 specifies that UDP broadcast packets are not forwarded to any host. udp-port-list\u2014Specifies the destination UDP port number to which to forward Broadcast packets (Range: 1\u201359999). This can be a list of port numbers separated by spaces. Default Configuration Forwarding of UDP Broadcast packets received on an interface to a specific (helper) address is disabled. If udp-port-list is not specified, packets for the default services are forwarded to the helper address. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines This command forwards specific UDP Broadcast packets from one interface to another, by specifying a UDP port number to which UDP broadcast packets with that destination port number are forwarded. By default, if no UDP port number is specified, the device forwards UDP broadcast packets for the following six services: IEN-116 Name Service (port 42) DNS (port 53) NetBIOS Name Server (port 137) NetBIOS Datagram Server (port 138) TACACS Server (port 49) Time Service (port 37) Many helper addresses may be defined. However, the total number of address-port pairs is limited to 128 for the device. The setting of a helper address for a specific interface has precedence over the setting of a helper address for all the interfaces. Forwarding of BOOTP/DHCP (ports 67, 68) cannot be enabled with this command. Use the DHCP relay commands to relay BOOTP/DHCP packets. The ip-interface argument cannot be the OOB port. Example The following example enables the forwarding of UDP Broadcast packets received on all interfaces to the UDP ports of a destination IP address and UDP port 1 and 2. switchxxxxxx(config)  ip helper-address all 172.16.9.9 49 53 1 2",

The definition of Forever is: the starting time is January 1, 2000, and the ending time is infinite. Command Mode Key Chain Key Configuration mode User Guidelines The switch checks Time-of-Date again a value of the start-time argument regardless if Time-of-Date is not set by management or by SNTP because of the default value of Time-of-Date always is an passed time. If validation of the value of the start-time argument was passed and the end-time argument is configured and its value is infinite the key is considered as actual regardless if Time-of-Date is not set by management or by SNTP. If Time-of-Date is not set by management or by SNTP and if the end-time argument is configured with a value differing from infinite or the duration parameter is configured, the key is considered as expired. If Time-of-Date is set by management or by SNTP, the switch checks Time-of-Date again a value of the end-time argument or of the duration parameter. If the last key expires, authentication will be finished with error. Example The following example configures a key chain called keychain1. The key named string1 will be accepted from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. and be sent from 2:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. The key named string2 will be accepted from 2:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. and be sent from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. The overlap allows for migration of keys or discrepancies in the set time of the router.

Syntax key key-id no key key-id Parameters key-id\u2014Identification number of an authentication key on a key chain. The range of keys is from 1 to 255. The key identification numbers need not be consecutive. The scope of a key identification number is the key chain where the key is defined. Default Configuration No key exists on the key chain. Command Mode Key-Chain Configuration mode User Guidelines It is useful to have multiple keys on a key chain so that the software can sequence through the keys as they become invalid after time, based on the accept-lifetime and send-lifetime key chain key command settings. Each key has its own key identifier, which is stored locally. The combination of the key identifier and the interface associated with the message uniquely identifies the authentication algorithm and authentication key in use. Only one authentication packet is sent, regardless of the number of valid keys. The software starts looking at the lowest key identifier number and uses the first valid key. If the last key expires, authentication will be finished with error. To remove all keys, remove the key chain by using the no key chain command. Example The following example configures a key chain named chain1. The key named key1 will be accepted from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. and be sent from 2:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. The key named key2 will be accepted from 2:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. and be sent from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. The overlap allows for migration of keys or a discrepancy in the set time of the router.

(Range: Valid IP address) Command Mode Privileged EXEC mode User Guidelines The traceroute command works by taking advantage of the error messages generated by routers when a datagram exceeds its time-to-live (TTL) value. The traceroute command starts by sending probe datagrams with a TTL value of one. This causes the first router to discard the probe datagram and send back an error message. The traceroute command sends several probes at each TTL level and displays the round-trip time for each. The traceroute command sends out one probe at a time. Each outgoing packet can result in one or two error messages. A \"time exceeded\u201d error message indicates that an intermediate router has seen and discarded the probe. A \"destination unreachable\" error message indicates that the destination node has received the probe and discarded it because it could not deliver the packet. If the timer goes off before a response comes in, the traceroute command prints an asterisk (*). The traceroute command terminates when the destination responds, when the maximum TTL is exceeded, or when the user interrupts the trace with Esc. The traceroute ipv6 command is not relevant to IPv6 link local addresses. Exampleswitchxxxxxx> traceroute ip umaxp1.physics.lsa.umich.edu Type Esc to abort.

A decimal value that indicates how many of the high-order contiguous bits of the address comprise the prefix (the network portion of the address). A slash mark must precede the decimal value. Default Configuration No IP address is defined for the interface. Command Mode Interface Configuration mode User Guidelines An Anycast address is an address that is assigned to a set of interfaces that typically belong to different nodes. A packet sent to an Anycast address is delivered to the closest interface\u2014as defined by the routing protocols in use\u2014identified by the Anycast address. Anycast addresses are syntactically indistinguishable from Unicast addresses because Anycast addresses are allocated from the Unicast address space. Nodes to which the Anycast address is assigned must be explicitly configured to recognize that the address is an Anycast address. Anycast addresses can be used only by a router, not a host, and Anycast addresses must not be used as the source address of an IPv6 packet. The subnet router Anycast address has a prefix concatenated by a series of zeros (the interface ID). The subnet router Anycast address can be used to reach a router on the link that is identified by the prefix in the subnet router Anycast address. The ipv6 address anycast command cannot be applied to define an IPv6 address on an ISATAP interface.

Stateless auto configuration is applied only when IPv6 Forwarding is disabled. When IPv6 forwarding is changed from disabled to enabled, and stateless auto configuration is enabled the switch stops stateless auto configuration and removes all stateless auto configured ipv6 addresses from all interfaces. When IPv6 forwarding is changed from enabled to disabled and stateless auto configuration is enabled the switch resumes stateless auto configuration.

    "page_content": "Use the ipv6 nd dad attempts command in Interface Configuration mode to configure the number of consecutive neighbor solicitation messages that are sent on an interface while duplicate address detection is performed on the Unicast IPv6 addresses of the interface. To return the number of messages to the default value, use the no form of this command. Syntax ipv6 nd dad attempts value no ipv6 nd dad attempts Parameters value\u2014The number of neighbor solicitation messages. The acceptable range is from 0 to 600. Configuring a value of 0 disables duplicate address detection processing on the specified interface; a value of 1 configures a single transmission without follow-up transmissions. Default Configuration 1 Command Mode Interface Configuration mode User Guidelines Duplicate address detection verifies the uniqueness of new Unicast IPv6 addresses before the addresses are assigned to interfaces (the new addresses remain in a tentative state while duplicate address detection is performed). Duplicate address detection uses neighbor solicitation messages to verify the uniqueness of Unicast IPv6 addresses. The DupAddrDetectTransmits node configuration variable (as specified in RFC 4862, IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration) is used to automatically determine the number of consecutive neighbor solicitation messages that are sent on an interface, while duplicate address detection is performed on a tentative Unicast IPv6 address. The interval between duplicate address detection, neighbor solicitation messages (the duplicate address detection timeout interval) is specified by the neighbor discovery-related variable RetransTimer (as specified in RFC 4861, Neighbor Discovery for IPv6), which is used to determine the time between retransmissions of neighbor solicitation messages to a neighbor when resolving the address or when probing the reachability of a neighbor. This is the same management variable used to specify the interval for neighbor solicitation messages during address resolution and neighbor unreachability detection. Duplicate address detection is suspended on interfaces that are administratively down. While an interface is administratively down, the Unicast IPv6 addresses assigned to the interface are set to a pending state. Duplicate address detection is automatically restarted on an interface when the interface returns to being administratively up. An interface returning to administratively up, restarts duplicate address detection for all of the Unicast IPv6 addresses on the interface. While duplicate address detection is performed on the link-local address of an interface, the state for the other IPv6 addresses is still set to TENTATIVE. When duplicate address detection is completed on the link-local address, duplicate address detection is performed on the remaining IPv6 addresses. When duplicate address detection identifies a duplicate address, the state of the address is set to DUPLICATE and the address is not used. If the duplicate address is the link-local address of the interface, the processing of IPv6 packets is disabled on the interface and an error SYSLOG message is issued. If the duplicate address is a global address of the interface, the address is not used and an error SYSLOG message is issued. All configuration commands associated with the duplicate address remain as configured while the state of the address is set to DUPLICATE. If the link-local address for an interface changes, duplicate address detection is performed on the new link-local address and all of the other IPv6 address associated with the interface are regenerated (duplicate address detection is performed only on the new link-local address). Note. Since DAD is not supported on NBMA interfaces the command is allowed but does not impact on an IPv6 tunnel interface of the ISATAP type it does not impact. The configuration is saved and will impacted when the interface type is changed on another type on which DAD is supported (for example, to the IPv6 manual tunnel). Example The following example configures five consecutive neighbor solicitation messages to be sent on VLAN 1 while duplicate address detection is being performed on the tentative Unicast IPv6 address of the interface. The example also disables duplicate address detection processing on VLAN 2. switchxxxxxx(config)  interface vlan 1 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  ipv6 nd dad attempts 5 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  exit switchxxxxxx(config)  interface vlan 2 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  ipv6 nd dad attempts 0 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  exit",

A value of 4,294,967,295 represents infinity. The address generated from a deprecated prefix should no longer be used as a source address in new communications, but packets received on such an interface are processed as expected. The preferred-lifetime must not be larger than the valid-lifetime. no-autoconfig\u2014Indicates to hosts on the local link that the specified prefix cannot be used for IPv6 autoconfiguration.The prefix will be advertised with the A-bit clear. off-link\u2014Configures the specified prefix as off-link. The prefix will be advertised with the L-bit clear. The prefix will not be inserted into the routing table as a connected prefix. If the prefix is already present in the routing table as a connected prefix (for example, because the prefix was also configured using the ipv6 address command), then it will be removed. no-onlink\u2014Configures the specified prefix as not on-link. The prefix will be advertised with the L-bit clear. Default Configuration All prefixes configured on interfaces that originate IPv6 router advertisements are advertised with a valid lifetime of 2,592,000 seconds (30 days) and a preferred lifetime of 604,800 seconds (7 days). Note that by default: All prefixes are inserted in the routing table as connected prefixes. All prefixes are advertised as on-link (for example, the L-bit is set in the advertisement) All prefixes are advertised as an auto-configuration prefix (for example, the A-bit is set in the advertisement) Command Mode Interface Configuration mode User Guidelines This command enables control over the individual parameters per prefix, including whether the prefix should be advertised. Use the ipv6 nd prefix ipv6-prefix/prefix-length command to add the prefix to the Prefix table. Use the no ipv6 nd prefix ipv6-prefix/prefix-length command to remove the prefix from the Prefix table. Use the no ipv6 nd prefix command without the ipv6-prefix/prefix-length argument o remove all prefixes from the Prefix Table. Note. The no ipv6 nd prefix command does not return the default values to the original default values. The switch supports the following advertisement algorithm: Advertise all prefixes that are configured as addresses on the interface using the parameters defined by the ipv6 nd prefix default command (or the default value if the command has not been configured) except refixes that are placed in the Prefix table (changed (configured) by the ipv6 nd prefix command). Advertise all prefixes configured by the ipv6 nd prefix command without the no-advertise keyword. Default Keyword The default keyword can be used to set default values for automatic advertised prefixes configured as addresses on the interface using the ipv6 address command. Note. These default values are not used as the default values in the ipv6 nd prefix command. Use the no ipv6 nd prefix default command to return the default values to the original default values. On-Link When on-link is \u201con\u201d (by default), the specified prefix is assigned to the link. Nodes sending traffic to such addresses that contain the specified prefix consider the destination to be locally reachable on the link. An on-link prefix is inserted into the routing table as a Connected prefix. Auto-configuration When auto-configuration is on (by default), it indicates to hosts on the local link that the specified prefix can be used for IPv6 auto-configuration. The configuration options affect the L-bit and A-bit settings associated with the prefix in the IPv6 ND Router Advertisement, and presence of the prefix in the routing table, as follows: Default L=1 A=1, In the Routing Table no-onlink L=0 A=1, In the Routing Table no-autoconfig L=1 A=0, In the Routing Table no-onlink no-autoconfig L=0 A=0, In the Routing Table off-link L=0 A=1, Not in the Routing Table off-link no-autoconfig L=0 A=0, Not in the Routing Table Examples Example 1.

    "page_content": "Use the ipv6 route command in Global Configuration mode to establish static IPv6 routes. To remove a previously configured static route, use the no form of this command. Syntax ipv6 route ipv6-prefix/prefix-length {next-ipv6-address [outgoing-interface-id]} | interface-id} [metric] no ipv6 route ipv6-prefix/prefix-length [{next-ipv6-address [outgoing-interface-id]} | interface-id] Parameters ipv6-prefix\u2014IPv6 network that is the destination of the static route. Can also be a host name when static host routes are configured. prefix-length\u2014Length of the IPv6 prefix. A decimal value that indicates how many of the high-order contiguous bits of the address comprise the prefix (the network portion of the address). A slash mark must precede the decimal value. next-ipv6-address\u2014IPv6 address of the next hop that can be used to reach the specified network. If the next-ipv6-address argument is a link local address it must be defined in the zone format: IPv6 Zone Format> := IPv6-Link-Local-Address%Interface-ID. The interface-id argument must be coded without spaces. outgoing-interface-id\u2014Outgoing Interface identifier. interface-id\u2014Outgoing Interface identifier. This argument can be applied only to point-to-point interfaces (manual IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels). metric\u2014Static route metric. Acceptable values are from 1 to 65535. The default value is 1. Default Configuration Static entries are not configured in the IPv6 neighbor discovery cache. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines Use the ipv6 route ipv6-prefix/prefix-length interface-id [metric] command to define a static route, if the outgoing interface is a manual tunnel. If the next-ipv6-address argument is a global IPv6 address that belongs to an on-link prefix you can omit the outgoing-interface-id argument and in this case the L2 interface on which this on-link prefix is defined will be used as the outgoing interface. If the outgoing-interface-id argument is configured it overrides this switch decision. If the next-ipv6-address argument is a global IPv6 address that does not belong to any on-link prefix you must configure the outgoing-interface-id argument. If the next-ipv6-address argument is a link-local IPv6 address and the outgoing-interface-id argument is omitted the zone of the next-ipv6-address argument will be used as the outgoing interface. If the outgoing-interface-id argument is configured it overrides this zone. Examples Example 1. The following example defines a static route with a global next hop: switchxxxxxx(config)  ipv6 route 2001:/64 5:5 10 Example 2. The following example defines a static route with a link-local next hop: switchxxxxxx(config)  ipv6 route 2001:DB8:2222:/48 FE80:260:3EFF:FE11:6770%vlan1 12 Example 3. The following example defines a static route on manual tunnel 1: switchxxxxxx(config)  ipv6 route 2001:DB8:2222:/48 tunnel1 Example 4. The following example defines a static route on with the outgoing interface: switchxxxxxx(config)  ipv6 route 2001:/64 5:5 vlan10 10",

NB Integrity does not establish binding for neighbors connected to these ports, but it does propagate the bindings established on perimeter ports. A dynamic IPv6 address bound to a port is deleted when its role is changed from perimetrical to internal. A static IPv6 address is kept. Example The following example defines a Neighbor Binding policy named policy 1 and configures the port role as an internal port:switchxxxxxx(config)  ipv6 neighbor binding policy policy1 switchxxxxxx(config-nbr-binding)  device-role internal switchxxxxxx(config-nbr-binding)  exit",

If the vlan keyword is not configured, the policy is applied to all VLANs on the device on which IPv6 First Hop Security is enabled. Default Configuration The IPv6 First Hop Security default policy is applied. Command Mode Interface (Ethernet, Port Channel) Configuration mode User Guidelines Use this command to attach an IPv6 First Hop Security policy to a port. Each succeeding usage of this command overrides the previous usage of the command with the same policy. Each time the command is used, it overrides the previous command within the same policy. If a policy specified by the policy-name argument is not defined, the command is rejected. Multiple policies with the vlan keyword can be attached to the same port if they do not have common VLANs. The set of rules that is applied to an input packet is built in the following way: The rules, configured in the policy attached to the port on the VLAN on which the packet arrived are added to the set. The rules, configured in the policy attached to the VLAN are added to the set if they have not been added. The global rules are added to the set if they have not been added.

If the vlan keyword is not configured, the policy is applied to all VLANs on the device on which RA Guard policy is enabled. Default Configuration The RA Guard default policy is applied. Command Mode Interface (Ethernet, Port Channel) Configuration mode User Guidelines Use this command to attach an RA Guard policy to a port. Each time the command is used, it overrides the previous command within the same policy. If a policy specified by the policy-name argument is not defined, the command is rejected. Multiple policies with the vlan keyword can be attached to the same port if they do not have common VLANs. The set of rules that is applied to an input packet is built in the following way: The rules, configured in the policy attached to the port on the VLAN on which the packet arrived are added to the set. The rules, configured in the policy attached to the VLAN are added to the set if they have not been added. The global rules are added to the set if they have not been added.

Syntax ipv6 prefix-list list-name [seq number] {deny|permit} ipv6-prefix/prefix-length [ge ge-length] [le le-length]} | description text no ipv6 prefix-list list-name [seq number] Parameters list-name\u2014Name of the prefix list. The name may contain up to 32 characters. seq seq-number\u2014Sequence number of the prefix list entry being configured. This is an integer value from 1 to 4294967294. deny\u2014Denies networks that matches the condition. permit\u2014Permits networks that matches the condition. ipv6-prefix\u2014IPv6 network assigned to the specified prefix list. This argument must be in the form documented in RFC 4293 where the address is specified in hexadecimal\u2014using 16-bit values between colons. prefix-length\u2014Length of the IPv6 prefix. A decimal value that indicates how many of the high-order contiguous bits of the address comprise the prefix (the network portion of the address). A slash mark must precede the decimal value from 0 to 128. The zero prefix-length may be used only with the zero ipv6-prefix (:). description text\u2014Text that can be up to 80 characters in length. ge ge-value\u2014Specifies a prefix length greater than or equal to the /prefix-length argument. It is the lowest value of a range of the length (the \u201cfrom\u201d portion of the length range). le le-value\u2014Specifies a prefix length less than or equal to the /prefix-length argument. It is the highest value of a range of the length (the \u201cto\u201d portion of the length range). Default Configuration No prefix list is created. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines This command without the seq keyword adds the new entry after the last entry of the prefix list with the sequence number equals to the last number plus 5. For example, if the last configured sequence number is 43, the new entry will have the sequence number of 48. If the list is empty, the first prefix-list entry is assigned the number 5 and subsequent prefix list entries increment by 5. This command with the seq keyword puts the new entry into the place specified by the parameter, if an entry with the number exists it is replaced by the new one. This command without the seq keyword removes the prefix list. The no version of this command with the seq keyword removes the specified entry. The sequence number of a prefix list entry determines the order of the entries in the list. The router compares network addresses to the prefix list entries. The router begins the comparison at the top of the prefix list, with the entry having the lowest sequence number. If multiple entries of a prefix list match a prefix, the entry with the lowest sequence number is considered the real match. Once a match or deny occurs, the router does not go through the rest of the prefix list. For efficiency, you might want to put the most common permits or denies near the top of the list, using the seq-number argument. IPv6 prefix lists are used to specify certain prefixes or a range of prefixes that must be matched before a permit or deny statement can be applied. Two operand keywords can be used to designate a range of prefix lengths to be matched. A prefix length of less than, or equal to, a value is configured with the le keyword. A prefix length greater than, or equal to, a value is specified using the ge keyword. The ge and le keywords can be used to specify the range of the prefix length to be matched in more detail than the usual ipv6-prefix/prefix-length argument. For a candidate prefix to match against a prefix list entry the following conditions must exist: The candidate prefix must match the specified prefix list and prefix length entry The value of the optional le keyword specifies the range of allowed prefix lengths from 0 up to the value of the le-length argument, and including, this value. The value of the optional ge keyword specifies the range of allowed prefix lengths from the value of the ge-length argument up to, and including, 128. Note that the first condition must match before the other conditions take effect. An exact match is assumed when the ge or le keywords are not specified. If only one keyword operand is specified then the condition for that keyword is applied, and the other condition is not applied. The prefix-length value must be less than the ge value. The ge value must be less than, or equal to, the le value. The le value must be less than or equal to 128. Every IPv6 prefix list, including prefix lists that do not have permit and deny condition statements, has an implicit deny any any statement as its last match condition. Formal Specification Checked prefix is cP and checked prefix length is cL. Function PrefixIsEqual(P1, P2, L) compares the first L bits of two addresses P1 and P2 and returns TRUE if they are equal. Case 1. A prefix-list entry is: P - prefix address L - prefix length ge - is not defined le - is not defined The prefix cP/cL matches the prefix-list entry if PrefixIsEqual(cP,P,L) & cL = L Case 2. An prefix-list entry is: P - prefix address L - prefix length ge - is defined le - is not defined The prefix cP/cL matches the prefix-list entry if PrefixIsEqual(cP,P,L) & cL >= ge Case 3. An prefix-list entry is: P - prefix address L - prefix length ge - is not defined le - is defined The prefix cP/cL matches to the prefix-list entry if PrefixIsEqual(cP,P,L) & cL <= le Case 4. An prefix-list entry is: P - prefix address L - prefix length ge - is defined le - is defined The prefix cP/cL matches the prefix-list entry if PrefixIsEqual(cP,P,L) & ge <= cL <= le Examples Example 1. The following example denies all routes with a prefix of :/0: switchxxxxxx(config)  ipv6 prefix-list abc deny :/0 Example 2. The following example permits the prefix 2002:/16: switchxxxxxx(config)  ipv6 prefix-list abc permit 2002:/16 Example 3. The following example shows how to specify a group of prefixes to accept any prefixes from prefix 5F00:/48 up to and including prefix 5F00:/64: switchxxxxxx(config)  ipv6 prefix-list abc permit 5F00:/48 le 64 Example 4. The following example denies prefix lengths greater than 64 bits in routes that have the prefix 2001:0DB8:/64: switchxxxxxx(config)  ipv6 prefix-list abc permit 2001:0DB8:/64 le 128 Example 5. The following example permits mask lengths from 32 to 64 bits in all address space: switchxxxxxx(config)  ipv6 prefix-list abc permit :/0 ge 32 le 64 Example 6. The following example denies mask lengths greater than 32 bits in all address space: switchxxxxxx(config)  ipv6 prefix-list abc deny :/0 ge 32 Example 7.

    "page_content": "Use the macro name Global Configuration mode command to define a macro. There are two types of macros that can be defined: Global macros define a group of CLI commands that can be run at any time. Smartport macros are associated with Smartport types. For each Smartport macro there must be an anti macro (a macro whose name is concatenated with no_). The anti macro reverses the action of the macro. If a macro with this name already exists, it overrides the previously-defined one. Use the no form of this command to delete the macro definition. Syntax macro name macro-name no macro name [macro-name] Parameters macro-name\u2014Name of the macro. Macro names are case sensitive. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines A macro is a script that contains CLI commands and is assigned a name by the user. It can contain up to 3000 characters and 200 lines. Keywords Macros may contain keywords (parameters). The following describes these keywords: A macro can contain up to three keywords. All matching occurrences of the keyword are replaced by the corresponding value specified in the macro command. Keyword matching is case-sensitive Applying a macro with keywords does not change the state of the original macro definition. User Feedback The behavior of a macro command requiring user feedback is the same as if the command is entered from terminal: it sends its prompt to the terminal and accepts the user reply. Creating a Macro Use the following guidelines to create a macro: Use macro name to create the macro with the specified name. Enter one macro command per line. Use the @ character to end the macro. Use the   character at the beginning of a line to enter a comment in the macro. In addition,   is used to identify certain preprocessor commands that can only be used within a macro. There are two possible preprocessor commands:  macro key description - Each macro can be configured with up to 3 keyword/description pairs. The keywords and descriptions are displayed in the GUI pages when the macro is displayed. The syntax for this preprocessor command is as follows:  macro key description $keyword1 description1 $keyword2 description2 $keyword3 description3 A keyword must be prefixed with '$'.  macro keywords - This instruction enables the device to display the keywords as part of the CLI help. It accepts up to 3 keywords. The command creates a CLI help string with the keywords for the macro. The help string will be displayed if help on the macro is requested from the macro and macro global commands. The GUI also uses the keywords specified in the command as the parameter names for the macro. See Example 2 and 3 below for a description of how this command is used in the CLI. The syntax for this preprocessor command is as follows:  macro keywords $keyword1 $keyword2 $keyword3 where $keywordn is the name of the keyword. Editing a Macro Macros cannot be edited. Modify a macro by creating a new macro with the same name as the existing macro. The newer macro overwrites the existing macro. The exceptions to this are the built-in macros and corresponding anti-macros for the Smartport feature. You cannot override a Smartport macro. Scope of Macro It is important to consider the scope of any user-defined macro. Because of the potential hazards of applying unintended configurations, do not change configuration modes within the macro by using commands such as exit, end, or interface interface-id. With a few exceptions, there are other ways of executing macros in the various configuration modes. Macros may be executed in Privileged Exec mode, Global Configuration mode, and Interface Configuration mode (when the interface is NOT a VLAN.) Examples Example 1 -The following example shows how to create a macro that configures the duplex mode of a port. switchxxxxxx(config)  macro name dup Enter macro commands one per line. End with the character \u2018@\u2019.  macro description dup duplex full negotiation @ Example 2 -The following example shows how to create a macro with the parameters: DUPLEX and SPEED. When the macro is run, the values of DUPLEX and SPEED must be provided by the user. The  macro keywords command enables the user to receive help for the macro as shown in Example 3. switchxxxxxx(config)  macro name duplex Enter macro commands one per line. End with the character \u2018@\u2019. duplex $DUPLEX no negotiation speed $SPEED  macro keywords $DUPLEX $SPEED @ Example 3 -The following example shows how to display the keywords using the help character ? (as defined by the  macro keywords command above) and then run the macro on the port. The  macro keywords command entered in the macro definition enables the user to receive help for the macro, as shown after the words e.g. below. switchxxxxxx(config)  interface gi1/0/1 switchxxxxxx(config-if)  macro apply duplex ? WORD <1-32> Keyword to replace with value e.g. $DUPLEX, $SPEED <cr> switchxxxxxx(config-if)  macro apply duplex $DUPLEX ?

Default Configuration The command has no default setting. Command Mode Interface (Ethernet, Port Channel) Configuration mode User Guidelines The macro apply command hides the commands of the macro from the user while it is being run. The macro trace command displays the commands along with any errors which are generated by them as they are executed. This is used to debug the macro and find syntax or configuration errors. When you run a macro, if a line in it fails because of a syntax or configuration error, the macro continues to apply the remaining commands to the interface. If you apply a macro that contains parameters in its commands, the command fails if you do not provide the values for the parameters. You can use the macro apply macro-name with a '?' to display the help string for the macro keywords (if you have defined these with the  macro keywords preprocessor command). Parameter (keyword) matching is case sensitive. All matching occurrences of the parameter are replaced with the provided value. Any full match of a keyword, even if it is part of a large string, is considered a match and replaced by the corresponding value. When you apply a macro to an interface, the switch automatically generates a macro description command with the macro name. As a result, the macro name is appended to the macro history of the interface. The show parser macro command displays the macro history of an interface. A macro applied to an interface range behaves the same way as a macro applied to a single interface. When a macro is applied to an interface range, it is applied sequentially to each interface within the range. If a macro command fails on one interface, it is nonetheless attempted to be applied and may fail or succeed on the remaining interfaces.

Default Configuration Enabled Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines Use the no form of the ipv6 mld snooping vlan querier election command to disable MLD Querier election mechanism on a VLAN. If the MLD Querier election mechanism is enabled, the MLD Snooping querier supports the standard MLD Querier election mechanism specified in RFC2710 and RFC3810. If MLD Querier election mechanism is disabled, MLD Snooping Querier delays sending General Query messages for 60 seconds from the time it was enabled. During this time, if the switch did not receive an IGMP query from another Querier - it starts sending General Query messages. Once the switch acts as a Querier, it will stop sending General Query messages if it detects another Querier on the VLAN. In this case, the switch will resume sending General Query messages if it does hear another Querier for Query Passive interval that equals to <Robustness>*<Query Interval> + 0.5*<Query Response Interval). It is recommended to disable MLD Querier election mechanism if there is an IPMv6 Multicast router on the VLAN.

Default Configuration No group entry exists. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User GuidelinesFor SNMP v1 and v2, this command performs the same actions as snmp-server community-group, except that snmp-server community-group configures both v1 and v2 at the same time. With this command, you must perform it once for v1 and once for v2. A local SNMP EngineID must be defined in order to add SNMPv3 users to the device. For remote hosts users a remote SNMP EngineID is also required. Changing or removing the value of snmpEngineID deletes the SNMPv3 users\u2019 database. The logical key of the command is username. Configuring a remote host is required in order to send informs to that host, because an inform is a trap that requires acknowledgment. A configured remote host is also able to manage the device (besides getting the informs). To configure a remote user, specify the IP address for the remote SNMP agent of the device where the user resides. Also, before you configure remote users for a particular agent, configure the SNMP engine ID, using the snmp-server engineID remote command. The remote agent's SNMP engine ID is needed when computing the authentication and privacy digests from the password. If the remote engine ID is not configured first, the configuration command fails. Since the same group may be defined several times, each time with different version or different access level (noauth, auth or auth & priv), when defining a user it is not sufficient to specify the group name, rather you must specify group name, version and access level for complete determination of how to handle packets from this user. Example This example assigns user tom to group abcd using SNMP v1 and v2c. . User jerry is assigned to group efgh using SNMP v3. switchxxxxxx(config)  snmp-server user tom acbd v1 switchxxxxxx(config)  snmp-server user tom acbd v2c switchxxxxxx(config)  snmp-server user jerry efgh v3 auth sha pass1234",

The name is used to reference the filter in other commands. (Length: 1\u201330 characters) oid-tree\u2014Specifies the ASN.1 subtree object identifier to be included or excluded from the view. To identify the subtree, specify a text string consisting of numbers, such as 1.3.6.2.4, or a word, such as System. Replace a single sub-identifier with the asterisk (*) wildcard to specify a subtree family; for example, 1.3.*.4. included\u2014Specifies that the filter type is included. excluded\u2014Specifies that the filter type is excluded. Default Configuration No view entry exists. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines This command can be entered multiple times for the same filter. If an object identifier is included in two or more lines, later lines take precedence. The command's logical key is the pair (filter-name, oid-tree). Example The following example creates a filter that includes all objects in the MIB-II system group except for sysServices (System 7) and all objects for interface 1 in the MIB-II interfaces group (this format depends on the parameters defined in ifEntry). switchxxxxxx(config)  snmp-server filter f1 system included switchxxxxxx(config)  snmp-server filter f2 system.7 excluded switchxxxxxx(config)  snmp-server filter f3 ifEntry.*.1 included",

Only a single match criteria in this class map must be matched. Default Configuration No class map. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines The class-map command and its subcommands are used to define packet classification, marking, and aggregate policing as part of a globally-named service policy applied on a per-interface basis. A class map consists of one or more ACLs. It defines a traffic flow by determining which packets match some or all of the criteria specified in the ACLs. All class map commands are only available when QoS is in advanced mode. The class-map enters Class-map Configuration mode. In this mode, up to two match commands can be entered to configure the criteria for this class. Each match specifies an ACL. When using a few match commands, each must point to a different type of ACL, such as: one IP ACL, one IPv6 ACL, and one MAC ACL. The classification is by first match, therefore, the order of the ACLs is important. Error messages are generated in the following cases: There is more than one match command in a match-all class map There is a repetitive classification field in the participating ACLs. After entering the Class-map Configuration mode, the following configuration commands are available: exit: Exits the Class-map Configuration mode. match: Configures classification criteria. no: Removes a match statement from a class map. Example The following example creates a class map called Class1 and configures it to check that packets match all classification criteria in the ACL specified. switchxxxxxx(config)  class-map class1 match-all switchxxxxxx(config-cmap)  match access-group acl-name",

DSCP remarking will have effect only if the mode is trust dscp. Default Configuration No aggregate policer is defined. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines This command is only available when QoS is in advanced mode. Use the qos aggregate-policer command to define a policer that aggregates traffic from multiple class maps. Aggregate policers cannot aggregate traffic from multiple devices. If the aggregate policer is applied to more than one device, the traffic on each device is counted separately and is limited per device. Traffic from two different ports on the same device can be aggregated for policing purposes. An aggregate policer can be applied to multiple classes in the same policy map. An aggregate policer cannot be deleted if it is being used in a policy map. The no police aggregate Policy-map Class Configuration mode command must first be used to delete the aggregate policer from all policy maps before using the no qos aggregate-policer command. Policing uses a token bucket algorithm. CIR represents the speed with which the token is added to the bucket. CBS represents the depth of the bucket. Examples Example 1. The following example defines the parameters of a policer called policer1 that can be applied to multiple classes in the same policy map. When the average traffic rate exceeds 124,000 kbps or the normal burst size exceeds 9600 bytes, the packet is dropped. switchxxxxxx(config)  qos aggregate-policer policer1 124000 9600 exceed-action dropExample 2.

To disable redistribution, use the no form of this command. Syntax redistribute protocol [metric {metric-value | transparent}] no redistribute protocol Parameters protocol\u2014Source protocol from which routes are being redistributed. It can be one of the following keywords: connected or static. metric transparent\u2014Causes RIP to use the source protocol metric for redistributed routes as the RIP metric. Only routes with metric less than 16 are redistributed. metric metric-value\u2014Specifies the metric assigned to the redistributed routes. The value supersedes the metric value specified using the default-metric command. Default Configuration Route redistribution is disabled Command Mode Router RIP Configuration mode User Guidelines Routes distributed to the source protocol are never redistributed by it The connected keyword is used to redistribute to RIP routes that correspond to defined IP interfaces on which RIP is not enabled. By default, the RIP Routing Table includes only routes that correspond only to IP interfaces on which it is enabled. The static keyword is used to redistribute to RIP static routes. By default, static routes are not redistributed to RIP. If the metric value is set by the route map (by the set metric command) then the value will supersede the metric value specified by the metric-value argument. If the metric keyword is not defined, then the metric is specified by the default-metric CLI command is assigned to the redistributed routes. If metric value set by the route map is equal or bigger than 16 the route is not redistributed. Changing or disabling any keyword will not affect the state of other keywords. Removing options that you have configured for the redistribute command requires careful use of the no form of the redistribute command to ensure that you obtain the result that you are expecting. Examples Example 1.The following example enables redistribution of static routes by RIP with transparent metric: switchxxxxxx(config)  router rip switchxxxxxx(config-rip)  redistribute static metric transparent switchxxxxxx(config-rip)  exit Example 2. The following example enables redistribution of static routes by RIP with transparent metric and then changes the metric to default: switchxxxxxx(config)  router rip switchxxxxxx(config-rip)  redistribute static metric transparent switchxxxxxx(config-rip)  no redistribute static metric transparent switchxxxxxx(config-rip)  exit Example 3. The following example enables redistribution of static routes by RIP with default metric and then changes the metric to transparent: switchxxxxxx(config)  router rip switchxxxxxx(config-rip)  redistribute static switchxxxxxx(config-rip)  redistribute static metric transparent switchxxxxxx(config-rip)  exit Example 4. The following example enables redistribution of static routes by RIP with transparent metric. The second redistribute command does not affect: switchxxxxxx(config)  router rip switchxxxxxx(config-rip)  redistribute static metric transparent switchxxxxxx(config-rip)  redistribute static switchxxxxxx(config-rip)  exit Example 5.

Syntax set router hardware-routing active Parameters This command has no arguments or keywords. Command Mode Privileged EXEC mode User Guidelines Hardware based routing is supported automatically on device once IPv4 or IPv6 route is enabled. However, hardware based routing is de-activated automatically by the software in cases where device hardware resources cannot support the amount of IPv4 and/or IPv6 entries. IPv4 entries - IPv4 interfaces/addresses and routes and as well as IPv4 Multicast entries; IPv6 entries - IPv6 interfaces/addresses and routes as well as IPv6 Multicast entries; Once Hardware based routing is de-activated by the system the user needs to apply the set router hardware-routing active command to re-activate hardware based routing on device. It is recommended to adjust the number of IPv4 and/or IPv6 entries on device to match the device hardware capabilities Once command is applied, the device begins to update all existing IP entries to device hardware tables. If process succeeds - hardware based routing will be re-activated. If process fails (for example device hardware resource are still not sufficient to support current device IP entries), hardware routing status will remain in-active. Syslog messages will indicate to user the start of the hardware table update process and the success or failure of such update. Examples Example 1. The following example the process of reactivating hardware based routing is applied. switchxxxxxx  set router hardware-routing active This operation may take a few moments. Example 2.

After entering the command, the current setting will be displayed, and the user will be required to confirm saving the new setting to the startup-configuration, following which system needs to be rebooted to apply changes. When this command is included in a configuration file that is downloaded to the device, if it is downloaded to the running configuration file, the command will be rejected. If it is downloaded to the startup configuration file, the device will not reboot automatically. The new settings will be used after the device is rebooted manually. Allocating additional resources for policy based routes and/or VLAN mapping entries, means that there are less resources to be used by IP type entries. Out of the entries allocated for VLAN Mapping - 8 entries are reserved for system use, and cannot be used for user based VLAN Mapping configuration. Data Validation: If the new policy based route and/or VLAN mapping values cannot be supported by device (due to relevant resource being used by other applications), the command is rejected and a message is displayed to the user. If the new max-number parameter is lower than the actual number of entries currently in-use settings, a confirmation message is displayed to the user (before the save confirmation message).

Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines Use the route-map command to enter route-map configuration mode. The purpose of the route map command is to define policy routing. The match commands specify the conditions under which policy routing occurs and the set commands specify the routing actions to perform if the criteria enforced by the match commands are met: If a outed packet matches to an ACL with the permit action the packet is forwarded by the set command (policy based routing). If a outed packet matches to an ACL with the deny action the frame is forwarded by the Forwarding table (regular routing). A route map can have several sections configured by separate route-map commands with the same map tag. When a routed packet is checked by a route map the first section which criteria is forced is applied. If there is no matched section the obvious shortest path using the Forwarding Table is applied. Examples Example 1. The following example gives an example of a route map with one section.

    "page_content": "The crypto certificate import Global Configuration mode command imports a certificate signed by a Certification Authority for HTTPS. In addition, the relevant key-pair can also be imported. Use the no form of the command to delete the user-defined keys and certificate. Syntax crypto certificate number import encrypted crypto certificate number import no crypto certificate number Parameters number\u2014Specifies the certificate number. (Range: 1\u20132). Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines Certificate needs to be imported from PEM encoding/file extension To end the session (return to the command line to enter the next command), enter a blank line. The imported certificate must be based on a certificate request created by the crypto cerificate request command. If only the certificate is imported, and the public key found in the certificate does not match the device's SSL key, the command fails. If both the public key and the certificate are imported, and the public key found in the certificate does not match the imported key, the command fails. This command is saved in the Running configuration file. When using the encrypted form of the command, only the private key must be in encrypted format.

Default Configuration Administrative state is Disabled Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines Regardless of the status of Auto Smartport, you can always manually apply a Smartport macro to its associated Smartport type. A Smartport macro is either a built-in macro or a user-defined macro. You can define and apply a macro using the CLI commands presented in the Macro Commands section. If the Auto Smartport Administrative state is controlled, the Auto Smartport Operational state is managed by the Voice VLAN manager and is set as follows: Auto Smartport Operational state is disabled when the OUI Voice VLAN is enabled. Auto Smartport Operational state is enabled when the Auto Voice VLAN is enabled. A user cannot enable Auto Smartport globally if the OUI Voice VLAN is enabled. Example This example shows an attempt to enable the Auto Smartport feature globally in the controlled mode. This is not possible because the OUI voice feature is enabled. The voice VLAN state is then disabled, after which Auto Smartports can be enabled. The appropriate VLANs are automatically enabled because the ports are configured for Auto Smartports on these VLANs. switchxxxxxx(config)  macro auto controlled switchxxxxxx(config)  macro auto enabled Auto smartports cannot be enabled because OUI voice is enabled. switchxxxxxx(config)  voice vlan state disabled switchxxxxxx(config)  macro auto enabled switchxxxxxx(config)  10-Apr-2011 16:11:31 %LINK-I-Up: Vlan 20 10-Apr-2011 16:11:33 %LINK-I-Up: Vlan 5 10-Apr-2011 16:11:33 %LINK-I-Up: Vlan 6 10-Apr-2011 16:11:33 %LINK-I-Up: Vlan 7 10-Apr-2011 16:11:33 %LINK-I-Up: Vlan 8 10-Apr-2011 16:11:33 %LINK-I-Up: Vlan 9 10-Apr-2011 16:11:33 %LINK-I-Up: Vlan 10",

The Remote VLAN must be created manually before configuring of the remote-span command. Guest VLAN cannot be configured as a Remote VLAN. All traffic into a RSPLAN VLAN is tagged and MAC learning is disabled in a RSPAN VLAN. The remote-span command verifies that all ports of the configured VLAN are egress tagged ports and disables MAC learning. The no remote-span command resets MAC learning. Note. The membership of a RSPAN remote VLAN depended where it is defined: Source or Start switch\u2014It is recommended that the RSPAN remote VLAN does not have any memberships. Intermediate switch\u2014It is recommended to remove the RSPAN remote VLAN from trunk ports not used for passing mirrored traffic to avoid superfluous flooding.

The interface ID can be one of the following types: Ethernet port or Port-channel. detail\u2014Displays detailed information. active\u2014Displays active ports only. Active ports are ports that are STP enabled and in the operational status of up. If device mode is PVST+ or Rapid PVST+ - ports also need to be members of the displayed VLAN. blockedports\u2014Displays blocked ports only. instance-id\u2014MST instance (Range:1\u2013 7). The parameter could be defined only when mode MSTP is enabled. vlan vlan-id\u2014Specifies the VLAN ID. (Range: 1\u20134094). The parameter could be defined only when mode PVST or RPVST is enabled. inconsistentports - Displays the ports that are in an inconsistent STP state. Command is relevant only when in PVST+ or Rapid PVST mode. mst-configuration\u2014Displays the MST configuration information. mst-configuration digest\u2014Displays the MST configuration digest information. Default Configuration If no interface is specified, the default is all interfaces. Command Mode Privileged EXEC mode User Guidelines This command only works when MST is enabled.

Default Configuration The Trusted Remote SSH Server table is empty. Command Mode Global Configuration mode User Guidelines Fingerprints are created by applying a cryptographic hash function to a public key. Fingerprints are shorter than the keys they refer to, making it simpler to use (easier to manually input than the original key). Whenever the switch is required to authenticate an SSH server\u2019s public key, it calculates the received key\u2019s fingerprint and compares it to the previously-configured fingerprint. The fingerprint can be obtained from the SSH server (the fingerprint is calculated when the public key is generated on the SSH server).

    "page_content": "Use the show platform certificate Privileged EXEC mode command to display the device SUDI certificate and optionally a signature over the certificate. Syntax show platform sudi certificate [sign [nonce <nonce value>] Parameters sign\u2014(Optional) display a signature over the certificate [nonce <nonce value>]\u2014(Optional) provide a nonce to use with the signature to protect from replay attacks. (range 0-4,294,967,295) Default Usage The certificate is displayed without a signature. If the sign parameter is specified without a nonce value then the signature will be generated without using a nonce. Command Mode Privileged EXEC mode User Guidelines show platform sudi certificate command displays the SUDI certificate. The command output includes the certificate chain in PEM format, where the first certificate that is displayed is the Cisco Root CA, and the second certificate that is displayed is the Cisco Subordinate/Intermediary Certificate. Both certificates can be verified to match the certificates published on https:/www.cisco.com/security/pki/. The third certificate is the SUDI leaf certificate. If the optional sign parameter is used, then the command output will display a signature over the certificates using the SUDI private key. The command also supports an optional [nonce <nonce value>] parameter used as part of the signature inputs to prevent replay attacks. If the [nonce <nonce value>] parameter is not provided the signed data will not include the nonce. The command output includes a signature version. The Signature value is set to 1 to indicate that the SUDI private key was used for signing. Examples Example 1: The following example displays the SUDI certificate chain without a signature: switchxxxxxx  show platform sudi certificate -BEGIN CERTIFICATE-

In the normal mode the device shuts down an interface if it explicitly detect that the link is unidirectional. A unidirectional link occurs whenever traffic sent by a local device is received by its neighbor but traffic from the neighbor is not received by the local device. You can use the following commands to reset an interface shut down by UDLD: The errdisable recover reset command with the interface interface-id parameter to reset a given interface.

Traffic received from this port will be tunneled with the additional 802.1q VLAN tag (Q-in-Q VLAN tunneling). Default Configuration Access mode. Command Mode Interface (Ethernet, Port Channel) Configuration mode User Guidelines When the port\u2019s mode is changed, it receives the configuration corresponding to the mode. If the port mode is changed to access and the access VLAN does not exist, then the port does not belong to any VLAN.Use the switchport mode vlan-mapping {tunnel | one-to-one} command to configure a VLAN mapping mode of an edge interface of a Provider Edge switch. The edge interface is an interface where a Customer network is connected to the Provider Edge switch. The network which the switch belongs to is a Provider network. These networks (Customer ones and Provider one) can use the same VLAN-IDs and the edge interface must perform vlan mapping between Customer VLANs (C-VLANs) and Provider VLANs (S-VLANs).On an edge interface C-VLANs are mapped to S-VLANs and the original C-VLAN tags are kept as part of payload. When a frame is sent on non-edge tagged interface, it is encapsulated with another layer of S-VLAN tag to which the original C-VLAN-ID is mapped. Therefore, transmitted on non-edge interfaces frames are double-tagged, with the outer S-VLAN tag and inner C-VLAN tag. When a frame is sent on an edge interface the S-VLAN tag is stripped.On an edge interface C-VLANs are mapped to the S-VLANs and the original C-VLAN-ID in input frame is replaced by the S-VLAN ID to which it is mapped. Untagged frames are dropped. Symmetrical translating back to the edge interface.The following features cannot be enabled if vlan-mapping is allowed: IPv4 routing IPv6 routing Auto Smart Port Voice VLAN The switchport vlan-mapping commands cannot add a port to a S-VLAN. IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces cannot be defined on VLANs containing edge interfaces. The following Layer 2 features are not supported into VLANs containing edge interfaces: IGMP Snooping MLD Snooping DHCP Snooping IPv6 First Hop Security The following protocols cannot be enabled on edge interfaces: STP GVRP The following features are not supported on edge interfaces: Radius VLAN assignment 802.1x Guest VLAN Egress ACLs are not supported on one-to-one VLAN mapping edge ports. A destination port with the network keyword or reflector port cannot be configured on an edge port. Note. All the limitations for edge ports specified above are checked by the switchport vlan-mapping commands and by the commands configuring these features. By default the switch does not forward frames received on edge ports with the following destination MAC addresses: 01:80:C2:00:00:00-01:80:C2:00:00:FF 01:00:0C:00:00:00-01:00:0C:FF:FF:FF 01:00:0C:CD:CD:D0 Note.

To delete the configuration, use the no form of this command. Syntax switchport vlan-mapping tunnel {vlan-list | default} {outer-vlan-id | drop} no switchport vlan-mapping tunnel [vlan-list | default] Parameters vlan-list\u2014Specifies the Customer VLANs (C-VLANs) for selective tunneling. The VLAN IDs in the list are separated by a comma or a series of VLAN IDs separated by a hyphen (for example 1,2,3-5). The range is from 1 to 4094. default\u2014Specifies the list of the C-VLANs other than those not specified.

The range of the S-VLAN tag is 1 to 4094. drop\u2014Specify that frames with the specified C-VLANs are dropped. Default Configuration No VLAN mapping is configured. Command Mode Interface (Ethernet, Port Channel) Configuration mode User Guidelines Use the switchport vlan-mapping tunnel vlan-list outer-vlan-id command to configure selective tunneling for the given C-VLANs. The S-VLAN specified by the outer-vlan-id argument must be created before configuring of this command. If this VLAN does not exist the command fails. Use the switchport vlan-mapping tunnel vlan-list drop command to configure selective drop for the given C-VLANs. Use the switchport vlan-mapping tunnel default outer-vlan-id command to configure tunneling for C-VLANs other than those not specified. Use the switchport vlan-mapping tunnel default drop command to configure drop C-VLANs other than those not specified. The switchport vlan-mapping tunnel command performs the following actions: Creates an ACL for mapping VLANs from vlan-list to outer-vlan-id, it has not been created. Adds to the ACL one rule for each VLAN from vlan-list. Reserves the place into TTI for this ACL. If there is not enough free place into TTI the command fails. Note. The ACL can be bound on the interface later by the vlan-mapping tunnel command. Adds the edge interface to the VLAN specified by the outer-vlan-id argument. The ACL contains V+1 rules, where: V\u2014The number of specified C-VLANs. A few switchport vlan-mapping tunnel commands can be defined on the same interface, only if their vlan-list arguments do not contain common VLAN-IDs. Use the no switchport vlan-mapping tunnel vlan-list command to delete tunneling for the specified C-VLANs and remove the interface from the corresponding S-VLANs. Use the no switchport vlan-mapping tunnel default command to delete the default tunneling and remove the interface from the corresponding S-VLANs. Use the no switchport vlan-mapping tunnel command to delete tunneling for all C-VLANs and remove the interface from the corresponding S-VLANs.

CDP cannot be both enabled and also tunneled on the same interfaces. To enable CDP tunneling on a Port Channel interface, CDP first needs to be disabled on all the members of the Port Channel (active and in-active). Likewise, an Ethernet Interface with CDP enabled cannot be added to a Port Channel on which CDP tunneling is enabled. LLDP cannot be both enabled and also tunneled on the same interfaces.

If the state is set to dynamic voice VLAN (auto-triggered) mode then voice VLAN is enabled by a trigger (advertisement received by voice device attached to port).

A CDP voice VLAN advertisement is received from a neighboring CDP device that is not a a device of the same family as the current device. A Voice Service Discovery Protocol (VSDP) message was received from a neighbor switch. VSDP is a Cisco Small Business proprietary protocol for SF and SG series managed switches. In all other cases the operational state is disabled. Notes: To change the administrative state from oui-enabled to auto-enabled (or auto-triggered), or vice versa, you must first set the administrative state to disabled. The administrative state cannot be set to oui-enabled if the Auto SmartPort administrative state is enabled. The administrative state cannot be set to oui-enabled if the voice VLAN is the default VLAN (VLAN 1). For oui-enabled mode, the voice VLAN cannot be 1.
