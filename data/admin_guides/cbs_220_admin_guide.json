The PoE switches are PSE (Power Sourcing Equipment) that are capable of supplying DC power to attaching powered devices (PD). These devices include VoIP phones, IP cameras, and wireless access points. The PoE switches can detect and supply power to pre-standard legacy PoE PD. Due to the PoE legacy support, it is possible that a PoE switch acting as a PSE may mistakenly detect and supply power to an attaching PSE, including other PoE switches, as a legacy PD. Even though PoE switches are PSE, and as such should be powered by AC, they could be powered up as a legacy PD by another PSE due to false detection. When this happens, the PoE switch may not operate properly and may not be able to properly supply power to its attaching PDs. To prevent false detection, you should disable PoE on the ports on the PoE switches that are used to connect to PSEs. You should also first power up a PSE device before connecting it to a PoE switch. When a device is being falsely detected as a PD, you should disconnect the device from the PoE port and power recycle the device with AC power before reconnecting its PoE ports.",

When the switch is using a DHCP server-assigned IP address or an administrator has configured a static IP address, the System LED is a steady green (DHCP is enabled by default). If you are managing the switch through a network connection and the switch IP address is changed, either by a DHCP server or manually, your access to the switch will be lost. You must enter the new IP address that the switch is using into your browser to use the web-based interface. If you are managing the switch through a console port connection, the link is retained. To configure the switch using the web-based interface: Procedure Step 1 Power on the computer and your switch. Step 2 Connect the computer to any network port. Step 3 Set up the IP configuration on your computer. If the switch is using the default static IP address of 192.168.1.254/24, you must choose an IP address for the computer in the range of 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.253 that is not already in use. If the IP addresses will be assigned by DHCP, make sure that your DHCP server is running and can be reached from the switch and the computer. You may need to disconnect and reconnect the devices for them to discover their new IP addresses from the DHCP server. Note Details on how to change the IP address on your computer depend upon the type of architecture and operating system that you are using. Use your computers local Help and Support functionality and search for \u201cIP Addressing.\u201d Step 4 Open a web browser window. Step 5 Enter the switch IP address in the address bar and press Enter. For example, http:/192.168.1.254. Step 6 When the login page appears, choose the language that you prefer to use in the web-based interface and enter the username and password. The default username is cisco. The default password is cisco. Usernames and passwords are both case sensitive. Step 7 Click Log In. If this is the first time that you have logged on with the default username and password, the Change username and Password page opens. The rules for constructing a new password are displayed on the page. Step 8 Enter a new username and password and confirm. Note Password complexity is enabled by default. The password must comply with the default complexity rules. Step 9 Click Apply. Caution Make sure that any configuration changes made are saved before exiting from the web-based interface by clicking on the Save icon. Exiting before you save your configuration results in all changes being lost. The Getting Started page opens. You are now ready to configure the switch.

    "page_content": "The SPAN feature, which is sometimes called port mirroring or port monitoring, selects network traffic for analysis by a network analyzer. The network analyzer can be a Cisco Switch Probe device or other Remote Monitoring (RMON) probes. Port mirroring is used on a network device to send a copy of network packets, seen on a single device port, multipledevice ports, or an entire VLAN, to a network monitoring connection on another port on the device. This is commonly used when monitoring of network traffic, such as for an intrusion-detection system, is required. A network analyzer, connected to the monitoring port, processes the data packets. A packet, which is received on a network port and assigned to a VLAN that is subject to mirroring, is mirrored to the analyzer port even if the packet was eventually trapped or discarded. Packets sent by the device are mirrored when Transmit (Tx) mirroring is activated. RSPAN supports source ports, source VLANs, and destination ports on different switches, enabling remote monitoring of multiple switches across your network. The traffic for each RSPAN session is carried over a user-specified RSPAN VLAN that is dedicated for that RSPAN session in all participating switches. The RSPAN traffic from the source ports or VLANs is copied into the RSPAN VLAN and forwarded carrying the RSPAN VLAN to a destination session monitoring the RSPAN VLAN. Mirroring does not guarantee that all traffic from the source port(s) is received on the analyzer (destination) port. If more data is sent to the analyzer port than it can support, some data might be lost.",

    "page_content": "Installation of new networking devices or replacement of devices can be expensive, time-consuming and error-prone when performed manually. Typically, new devices are first sent to a central staging facility where the devices are unboxed, connected to a staging network, updated with the right licenses, configurations and images; then packaged and shipped to the actual installation location. After these processes are completed, experts must travel to the installation locations to perform the installation. Even in scenarios where the devices are installed in the NOC/Data Center itself, there may not be enough experts for the sheer number of devices. All these issues contribute to delays in deployment and add to the operational costs. Connecting to PNP Server To allow the switch to connect to the PnP server, a discovery process takes place, in which the switch discovers the PNP server address/url. There are multiple discovery methods, and they are executed by the switch according to the sequence detailed below. If a PnP server is discovered by a certain method, the discovery process is completed and the rest of the methods are not executed: User configured address - the PnP server url or IP address are specified by the user. Address received from DHCP response option 43 - the PnP server url or IP address are received as part of option 43 in the DHCP response DNS resolution of hostname \"pnpserver\" - the PnP server IP addressed is obtained via DNS server resolution of hostname \u201cpnpserver\u201d. Cisco Plug and Play Connect - a redirection service that allows full \u201cout of the box\u201d PNP server discovery which runs over HTTPs. The switch contacts the redirection service using the FQDN \u201cdevicehelper.cisco.com\u201d. Cisco PnP Connect Prerequisites To allow Cisco Plug and Play Connect operation, the user needs to create devices and controller profiles in Plug and Play Connect (navigate to https:/software.cisco.com and click the PnP Connect link). Note that a Cisco Smart Account is required to use PnP Connect. To create or update a Smart Account, see the Administration section of https:/software.cisco.com. In addition, the following prerequisites are required to be met on the switch itself: The PNP server was not discovered by the other discovery methods The device is able to successfully resolve the name devicehelper.cisco.com (either static configuration or using DNS server) System time was set using one of the following methods Time was updated by an SNTP server Clock was set manually by user Time was preserved across resets by Real Time Clock (RTC). CA-Signed Certificate based Authentication Cisco distributes certificates signed by a signing authorities in .tar file format and signs the bundle with Cisco Certificate Authority (CA) signature. This certificate bundle is provided by Cisco infoSec for public downloads on cisco.com. Note If the PNP server discovery is based on Cisco PnP Connect, the trustpool is downloaded from following: http:/www.cisco.com/security/pki/trs/ios_core.p7b. If the PNP server discovery is based on DHCP option 43, use the \u201cT<Trust pool CA bundle URL>;\u201d parameter in DHCP option 43 to provide the URL for downloading the trust pool. The certificates from this bundle can be installed on the Cisco device for server-side validation during SSL handshake. It is assumed that the server uses a certificate, which is signed by one of the CA that is available in the bundle. The PnP agent uses the built-in PKI capability to validate the certificate bundle. As the bundle is signed by Cisco CA, the agent is capable of identifying a bundle that is tampered before installing the certificates on the device. After the integrity of the bundle is ensured by the agent, the agent installs the certificates on the device. After the certificates are installed on the device, the PnP agent initiates an HTTPs connection to the server without any additional steps from the server. Note The device also supports a built in certificate bundle which is installed as part of the bootup process. this bundle can be used to validate PNP server. If a Bundle is downloaded based on Cisco PnP Connect information then the certificates from the downloaded bundle are installed and the certificates based on the built in bundle are uninstalled. Note In addition to validating PNP certificate based on installed CA certificate the PNP Agent also validates that the certificate's Common Name/Subject Alternate Name (CN/SAN) matches the hostname/IP address of the PNP server. If they don't match validation of certificate is rejected. Cisco PnP DHCP Option 43 Usage Guidelines DHCP option 43 is a vendor specific identifier which is one of the methods that can be used by the PnP agent to locate and connect to the PnP server (see Cisco Plug-n-Play for more information). The following provides Information on configuration of Option 43 to allow proper configuration on DHCP server. Option 43 includes the following fields/parameters: <DHCP-typecode><feature-opcode><version><debug-option>;<arglist> The <arglist> parameter should use the following syntax: B<IP address type>;I<IP address>;J<Port>;K<Transport protocol>;T<Trust pool CA bundle URL>;Z<SNTP server IP address> The following table details the description and usage of option 43 fields Parameter Description DHCP-typecode DHCP sub-option type. The DHCP sub-option type for PnP is 5. Feature-opcode Feature operation code \u2013 can be either Active (A) or Passive (P). The feature operation code for PnP is Active (A) which implies that PnP agent initiates a connection to the PnP server. If the PnP server cannot be reached, PnP agent retries until it makes a connection. Version Version of template to be used by PnP agent. Must be 1. Debug-option Turns ON or OFF the debug messages during the processing of the DHCP Option 43: D \u2013 debug option is ON ; N \u2013 debug option is OFF. K Transport protocol to be used between PnP agent and PnP server: 4 - HTTP or 5 \u2013 HTTPS. B IP address type of PnP server IP address specified with the letter code \u2018I\u2019: 1 - host , 2- IPv4 , 3 - IPv6 I IP address or hostname of PnP server. If hostname is specified, DNS related options must be present in the DHCP server to allow for successful use of hostname. T URL of trust pool CA bundle. You can get the CA bundle from a Cisco Business Dashboard, or from a TFTP server. When using Cisco Business Dashboard, use the following URL format: http:/CBD IP address or domain name/ca/trustpool/CA_bundle_name When using TFTP Server, use the following URL format: tftp:/tftp server IP/CA_bundle_name Z SNTP server IP address. You must sync the clock before configuring a trust pool. Note The switch clock is considered synchronized if it was updated by any SNTP server supported by the switch (by default, user configured or in Z parameter) or set manually by the user. This parameter is required when using trust pool security if the switch can not reach any other SNTP server. For example, for an out-of-the box switch with factory default configuration but no Internet connectivity to reach the default SNTP servers. J Port number http=80 https=443 Examples for Option 43 usage: The following format is used for PnP connection setup using HTTP: option 43 ascii 5A1N;K4;B2;I10.10.10.3;J80 The following format is used for PnP connection setup on top of HTTPS, directly using a trust pool. HTTPS can be used when the trust pool CA bundle is downloaded from a Cisco Business Dashboard and the Cisco Business Dashboard server certificate was issued by a 3rd party (not self signed). In the example below \u201c10.10.10.3\u201d is the Cisco Business Dashboard IP address. Optionally, you can specify a domain name: option 43 ascii 5A1N;K5;B2;I10.10.10.3;J443;Thttp:/10.10.10.3/ca/trustpool/ios.p7b;Z10.75.166.1",

Cisco Discovery Protocol is enabled by default. Each device configured for Cisco Discovery Protocol advertises at least one address at which the device can receive messages and sends periodic advertisements (messages) to the well-known multicast address 01:00:0C:CC:CC:CC. Devices discover each other by listening at that address. They also listen to messages to learn when interfaces on other devices are up or go down. Advertisements contain time-to-live information, which indicates the length of time a receiving device should hold Cisco Discovery Protocol information before discarding it. Advertisements supported and configured in Cisco software are sent, by default, every 60 seconds on interfaces that support Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAP) headers. Cisco devices never forward Cisco Discovery Protocol packets. Cisco devices that support Cisco Discovery Protocol store the information received in a table. Information in this table is refreshed every time an advertisement is received, and information about a device is discarded after three advertisements from that device are missed.

CDP Mandatory TLVs Validation If selected, incoming CDP packets not containing the mandatory TLVs are discarded and the invalid error counter is incremented. CDP Version Select the version of CDP to use. CDP Hold Time Amount of time that CDP packets are held before the packets are discarded, measured in multiples of the TLV Advertise Interval. For example, if the TLV Advertise Interval is 30 seconds, and the Hold Multiplier is 4, then the CDP packets are discarded after 120 seconds. The following options are possible: Use Default\u2014Use the default time (180 seconds) User Defined\u2014Enter the time in seconds. CDP Transmission Rate The rate in seconds at which CDP advertisement updates are sent.

Interface IF User Defined was selected for Source Interface, select the interface. Syslog Voice VLAN Mismatch Check to send a SYSLOG message when a voice VLAN mismatch is detected. This means that the voice VLAN information in the incoming frame does not match what the local device is advertising. Syslog Native VLAN Mismatch Check to send a SYSLOG message when a native VLAN mismatch is detected. This means that the native VLAN information in the incoming frame does not match what the local device is advertising. Syslog Duplex Mismatch Check to send a SYSLOG message when duplex information is mismatched.

    "page_content": "This section describes how to use the PoE feature. A PoE device is Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE) that delivers electrical power to a connected Pod Devices (PD) over existing copper cables without interfering with the network traffic, updating the physical network or modifying the network infrastructure. PoE provides the following features: Eliminates the need to run 110/220 V AC power to all devices on a wired LAN. Eliminates the need to deploy double cabling systems in an enterprise significantly decreasing installation costs. Power over Ethernet can be used in any enterprise network that deploys relatively low-pod devices connected to the Ethernet LAN, such as: IP phones, Wireless access points, IP gateways, Audio and video remote monitoring devices. PoE implements in the following stages: Detection\u2014Sends special pulses on the copper cable. When a PoE device is located at the other end, that device responds to these pulses. Classification\u2014Negotiation between the Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE) and the Pod Device (PD) commences after the Detection stage. During negotiation, the PD specifies its class, which indicates maximum amount of power that the PD consumes. Power Consumption\u2014After the classification stage completes, the PSE provides power to the PD. If the PD supports PoE, but without classification, it is assumed to be class 0 (the maximum). If a PD tries to consume more power than permitted by the standard, the PSE stops supplying power to the port. PoE supports two modes: Port Limit\u2014The maximum power the device agrees to supply is limited to the value the system administrator configures, regardless of the Classification result. Class Power Limit\u2014The maximum power the device agrees to supply is determined by the results of the Classification stage. This means that it is set as per the Client's request. Warning The PoE unit is to be connected only to PoE networks without routing to the outside plant.",

When the switch is connected to an IP Phone, the phone sends voice traffic with Layer 3 IP precedence and Layer 2 class of service (CoS) values, which are both set to 5 by default. Because the sound quality of an IP phone call can deteriorate if the data is unevenly sent, the switch supports quality of service (QoS) based on IEEE 802.1p CoS. QoS uses classification and scheduling to send network traffic from the switch in a predictable manner. Voice VLAN can propagate the CoS/802.1p and DSCP settings by using LLDP-MED Network policies. The LLDP-MED is set by default to response with the Voice QoS setting if an appliance sends LLDP-MED packets. MED-supported devices must send their voice traffic with the same CoS/802.1p and DSCP values, as received with the LLDP-MED response.You can disable the automatic update between Voice VLAN and LLDP-MED and use your own network polic ies. Working with the OUI mode, the device can additionally configure the mapping and remarking (CoS/802.1p) of the voice traffic based on the OUI. By default, all interfaces are CoS/802.1p trusted. The device applies the quality of service based on the CoS/802.1p value found in the voice stream. For Telephony OUI voice streams, you can override the quality of service and optionally remark the 802.1p of the voice streams by specifying the desired CoS/802.1p values and using the remarking option under Telephony OUI.",

    "page_content": "The global MSTP configures a separate Spanning Tree for each VLAN group and blocks all but one of the possible alternate paths within each spanning tree instance. MSTP enables formation of MST regions that can run multiple MST instances (MSTI). Multiple regions and other STP bridges are interconnected using one single common spanning tree (CST). MSTP is fully compatible with RSTP bridges, in that an MSTP BPDU can be interpreted by an RSTP bridge as an RSTP BPDU. This not only enables compatibility with RSTP bridges without configuration changes, but also causes any RSTP bridges outside of an MSTP region to see the region as a single RSTP bridge, regardless of the number of MSTP bridges inside the region itself. For two or more switches to be in the same MST region, they must have the same VLANs to MST instance mapping, configuration revision number, and region name. Switches intended to be in the same MST region are never separated by switches from another MST region. If they are separated, the region becomes two separate regions. This mapping can be done in the MSTP Instance Settings. Use this page if the system operates in MSTP mode. To define MSTP, follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Spanning Tree > MSTP > MSTP Properties. Step 2 Enter the parameters. Region Name\u2014Define an MSTP region name. Revision\u2014Define an unsigned 16-bit number that identifies the revision of the current MST configuration. The field range is 0\u201365535.

Multicast applications are useful for dissemination of information to multiple clients, where clients do not require reception of the entire content. A typical application is a cable-TV-like service, where clients can join a channel in the middle of a transmission, and leave before it ends. The data is sent only to relevant ports. Forwarding the data only to the relevant ports conserves bandwidth and host resources on links. By default, all Multicast frames are flooded to all ports of the VLAN. It is possible to selectively forward only to relevant ports and filter (drop) the Multicast on the rest of the ports by enabling the Bridge Multicast filtering status in this section. Multicast addresses have the following properties Each IPv4 Multicast address is in the address range 224.0.0.0 to239.255.255.255. The IPv6 Multicast address isFF00:/8. To map an IP Multicast group address to an Layer 2 Multicast address: For IPv4, this is mapped by taking the 23 low-order bits from the IPv4 address, and adding them to the 01:00:5e prefix. By standard, the upper nine bits of the IP address are ignored, and any IP addresses that only differ in the value of these upper bits are mapped to the same Layer 2 address, since the lower 23 bits that are used are identical. For example, 234.129.2.3 is mapped to a MAC Multicast group address 01:00:5e:01:02:03. Up to 32 IP Multicast group addresses can be mapped to the same Layer 2 address. For IPv6, this is mapped by taking the 32 low-order bits of the Multicast address, and adding the prefix of 33:33. For example, the IPv6 Multicast address FF00:1122:3344 is mapped to Layer 2 Multicast 33:33:11:22:33:44.

IPv4 multicast packets are delivered using the Ethernet MAC address range 01:00:5e:00:00:00\u201301:00:5e:7f:ff:ff. This range has 23 bits of available address space. The first octet (01) includes the broadcast/multicast bit. The lower 23 bits of the 28-bit multicast IP address are mapped into the 23 bits of available Ethernet address space. This means that there is ambiguity in delivering packets. If two hosts on the same subnet each subscribe to a different multicast group whose address differs only in the first 5 bits, Ethernet packets for both multicast groups will be delivered to both hosts, requiring the network software in the hosts to discard the unrequired packets. To support selective IPv4 Multicast forwarding, bridge Multicast filtering must be enabled (in Multicast Properties). The IGMP Snooping must be enabled globally and for each relevant VLAN in the IGMP Snooping page. To enable IGMP Snooping and identify the device as an IGMP Snooping Querier on a VLAN, follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Multicast > IGMP Snooping. Step 2 Enter the following information: IGMP Snooping Version\u2014Select either IGMPv2 or IGMPv3. Report Suppression\u2014Enable or disable IGMP report suppression. Disabling this feature will forward all IGMP reports to Multicast routers. Note IGMP report suppression is supported only when the Multicast query has IGMPv1 and IGMPv2 reports. This feature is not supported when the query includes IGMPv3 reports. The switch uses IGMP report suppression to forward only one IGMP report per Multicast router query to Multicast devices. When IGMP report suppression is enabled, the switch sends the first IGMP report from all hosts for a group to all Multicast routers. The switch does not send the remaining IGMP reports for the group to the Multicast routers. This feature prevents duplicate reports from being sent to the Multicast devices. The switch always forwards only the first IGMPv1 or IGMPv2 report from all hosts for a group to all Multicast routers, regardless of the Multicast router query also includes requests for IGMPv3 reports. Step 3 Click Apply. Step 4 To configure IGMP on an interface, select a static VLAN and click Edit. Enter the following fields: Option Description VLAN ID Select The VLAN Id from the dropdown list. IGMP Snooping Status Select to enable IGMP Snooping on the VLAN. The device monitors network traffic to determine which hosts have asked to be sent Multicast traffic. Multicast Router Ports Auto Learn Select to enable Auto Learn of the Multicast router. Query Robustness Enter the robustness variable value to be used if this switch is the elected querier. Query Interval Enter the interval between the general queries to be used if this switch is the elected. querier. Query Max Response Interval Enter the delay used to calculate the maximum response code inserted into the periodic general queries. Last Member Query Counter Number of IGMP group-specific queries sent before the device assumes that there are no more members for the group, if the device is the elected querier. Last Member Query Interval Enter the maximum response delay to be used if the switch cannot read maximum response time value from group specific queries sent by the elected querier. Immediate Leave Select to enable the switch to remove an interface that sends a leave message from the forwarding table without first sending out MAC-based general queries to the interface. When an IGMP Leave Group message is received from a host, the system removes the host port from the table entry. After it relays the IGMP queries from the Multicast router, it deletes entries periodically if it doesn\u2019t receive any IGMP membership reports from the Multicast clients. When enabled, this feature reduces the time it takes to block unnecessary IGMP traffic sent to a device port. IGMP Querier Status Select to enable this feature. This feature is required if there\u2019s no Multicast router. IGMP Querier Version Select the IGMP version to be used if the device becomes the elected querier. Select IGMPv3 if there are switches and/or Multicast routers in the VLAN that perform source-specific IP Multicast forwarding. Otherwise, select IGMPv2. Step 5 Click Apply. The Running Configuration file is updated. Note Changes in IGMP Snooping timers configuration, such as: Query Robustness, Query Interval etc. don\u2019t take effect on timers which already created.",

The static IP address and default gateway are configured on the IPv4 Interface and IPv6 Interface pages. The switch uses the default gateway, if configured, to communicate with devices that are not in the same IP subnet with the switch. By default, VLAN 1 is the management VLAN, but this can be modified. The switch can only be reached at the configured IP address through its management VLAN. The factory default setting of the IPv4 address configuration is DHCPv4. This means that the switch acts as a DHCPv4 client, and sends out a DHCPv4 request during boot up. If the switch receives a DHCPv4 response from the DHCPv4 server with an IPv4 address, it sends Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) packets to confirm that the IP address is unique. If the ARP response shows that the IPv4 address is in use, the switch sends a DHCPDECLINE message to the offering DHCP server, and sends another DHCPDISCOVER packet that restarts the process. If the switch does not receive a DHCPv4 response in 60 seconds, it continues to send DHCPDISCOVER queries, and adopts the default IPv4 address: 192.168.1.254/24. IP address collisions occur when the same IP address is used in the same IP subnet by more than one device. Address collisions require administrative actions on the DHCP server and/or the devices that collide with the switch. When a VLAN is configured to use dynamic IPv4 addresses, the switch issues DHCPv4 requests until it is assigned an IPv4 address from a DHCPv4 server. Only the management VLAN can be configured with a static or dynamic IP address. The IP address assignment rules for the switch are as follows: Unless the switch is configured with a static IP address, it issues DHCPv4 requests until a response is received from the DHCP server. The System LED on the front panel of the switch changes to solid green when a new unique IP address is received from the DHCP server. If a static IP address has been set, the System LED also changes to solid green. The System LED flashes when the switch is acquiring an IP address and is currently using the factory default IP address 192.168.1.254. The same rules apply when a client must renew the lease, prior to its expiration date, through a DHCPREQUEST message. With the factory default settings, when no statically-defined or DHCP acquired IP address is available, the default IP address is used. When the other IP addresses become available, the addresses are automatically used. The default IP address is always on the management VLAN. To access and manage the switch by using the web-based interface, the switch management IP address must be defined and known. The default configuration of the switch is to use its factory default IP address of 192.168.1.254. The switch IP address can be manually configured.",

Network security can be increased by limiting access on a port to users with specific MAC addresses. The MAC addresses can be either dynamically learned or statically configured. Port security monitors received and learned packets. Access to locked ports is limited to users with specific MAC addresses. Port Security has two modes: Classic Lock\u2014All learned MAC addresses on the port are locked, and the port doesn\u2019t learn any new MAC addresses. The learned addresses aren\u2019t subject to aging or relearning. Limited Dynamic Lock\u2014The device learns MAC addresses up to the configured limit of allowed addresses. After the limit is reached, the device doesn\u2019t learn additional addresses. In this mode, the addresses are subject to aging and relearning. When a frame from a new MAC address is detected on a port where it\u2019s not authorized (the port is classically locked, and there\u2019s a new MAC address, or the port is dynamically locked, and the maximum number of allowed addresses has been exceeded), the protection mechanism is invoked, and one of the following actions can take place: Frame is discarded. Frame is forwarded. Frame is discarded and a SYSLOG message is generated. Port is shut down. When the secure MAC address is seen on another port, the frame is forwarded, but the MAC address isn\u2019t learned on that port. In addition to one of these actions, you can also generate traps, and limit their frequency and number to avoid overloading the devices. To configure port security, complete the following: Procedure Step 1 Click Security > Port Security. Step 2 Select an interface to be modified, and click Edit. Step 3 Enter the parameters. Interface\u2014Select the interface name. Interface Status\u2014Select to lock the port. Learning Mode\u2014Select the type of port locking. To configure this field, the Interface Status must be unlocked. The Learning Mode field is enabled only if the Interface Status field is locked. To change the Learning Mode, the Lock Interface must be cleared. After the mode is changed, the Lock Interface can be reinstated. The options are: Classic Lock\u2014Locks the port immediately, regardless of the number of addresses that have already been learned. Limited Dynamic Lock\u2014Locks the port by deleting the current dynamic MAC addresses associated with the port. The port learns up to the maximum addresses allowed on the port. Both relearning and aging of MAC addresses are enabled. Max No. of Addresses Allowed\u2014Enter the maximum number of MAC addresses that can be learned on the port if Limited Dynamic Lock learning mode is selected.

The Cisco device is an advanced device that handles management traffic, protocol traffic and snooping traffic, in addition to end-user (TCP) traffic. SCT ensures that the device receives and processes management and protocol traffic, no matter how much total traffic is received. This is done by rate-limiting TCP traffic to the CPU.",

    "page_content": "Dynamic Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a TCP/IP protocol for translating IP addresses into MAC addresses. ARP Cache Poisoning A malicious user can attack hosts, switches, and routers connected to a Layer 2 network by poisoning the ARP caches of systems connected to the subnet and by intercepting traffic intended for other hosts on the subnet. This situation can happen because ARP allows a gratuitous reply from a host even if an ARP request was not received. After the attack, all traffic from the device under attack flows through the attacker's computer and then to the router, switch, or host. How ARP Inspection Prevents Cache Poisoning The ARP inspection feature relates to interfaces as either trusted or untrusted (see Security > ARP Inspection > Interface Settings page). Interfaces are classified by the user as follows: Trusted\u2014Packets are not inspected. Untrusted\u2014Packets are inspected as described below. ARP inspection is performed only on untrusted interfaces. ARP packets that are received on the trusted interface are simply forwarded. Upon packet arrival on untrusted interfaces the following logic is implemented: Search the ARP access control rules for the packet's IP/MAC addresses. If the IP address is found and the MAC address in the list matches the packet's MAC address, then the packet is valid If the packet's IP address was not found, and DHCP Snooping is enabled for the packet\u2019s VLAN, search the DHCP Snooping Binding database for the packet's <VLAN - IP address> pair. If the <VLAN - IP address> pair was found, and the MAC address and the interface in the database match the packet's MAC address and ingress interface, the packet is valid. If the packet's IP address was not found in the ARP access control rules or in the DHCP Snooping Binding database the packet is invalid and is dropped. A SYSLOG message is generated. If a packet is valid, it is forwarded and the ARP cache is updated. If the ARP Packet Validation option is selected (on the Properties page), the following additional validation checks are performed: Source MAC Address\u2014Compares the packet\u2019s source MAC address in the Ethernet header against the sender\u2019s MAC address in the ARP request. This check is performed on both ARP requests and responses. Destination MAC Address\u2014Compares the packet\u2019s destination MAC address. This check is performed for ARP responses. IP Address\u2014Compares the ARP body for invalid and unexpected IP addresses. Addresses include 0.0.0.0, 255.255.255.255, and all IP Multicast addresses. Packets with invalid ARP Inspection bindings are logged and dropped. Interaction Between ARP Inspection and DHCP Snooping If DHCP Snooping is enabled, ARP Inspection uses the DHCP Snooping Binding database in addition to the ARP access control rules. If DHCP Snooping is not enabled, only the ARP access control rules are used. Table 1. ARP Default Option Default State Dynamic ARP Inspection Disabled ARP Packet Validation Disabled ARP Inspection Enabled on VLAN Disabled Log Buffer Interval SYSLOG message generation for dropped packets is enabled at 10 seconds interval.",

You need to translate the 1's to a hexadecimal value and you write 0 for every four zeros. In this example since 1111 1111 = FF, the mask would be written: as 00:00:00:00:00:FF. Source MAC Address\u2014Select Any if all source addresses are acceptable or User defined to enter a source address or range of source addresses.

There are two ways of determining how traffic in queues is handled, Strict Priority and Weighted Round Robin (WRR). Strict Priority\u2014Egress traffic from the highest-priority queue is transmitted first. Traffic from the lower queues is processed only after the highest queue has been transmitted, thus providing the highest level of priority of traffic to the highest numbered queue. Weighted Round Robin (WRR)\u2014In WRR mode the number of packets sent from the queue is proportional to the weight of the queue (the higher the weight the more frames are sent). For example, if there are a maximum of four queues possible and all four queues are WRR and the default weights are used, queue 1 receives 1/15 of the bandwidth (assuming all queues are saturated and there\u2019s congestion), queue 2 receives 2/15, queue 3 receives 4/15 and queue 4 receives 8 /15 of the bandwidth. The type of WRR algorithm used in the device isn\u2019t the standard Deficit WRR (DWRR), but rather Shaped Deficit WRR (SDWRR). The queuing modes can be selected in the Queue page. When the queuing mode is by strict priority, the priority sets the order in which queues are serviced, starting with the highest priority queue and going to the next lower queue when each queue is completed. When the queuing mode is Weighted Round Robin, queues are serviced until their quota has been used up and then another queue is serviced. It\u2019s also possible to assign some of the lower queues to WRR, while keeping some of the higher queues in strict priority. In this case traffic for the strict-priority queues is always sent before traffic from the WRR queues. Only after the strict-priority queues have been emptied is traffic from the WRR queues forwarded. (The relative portion from each WRR queue depends on its weight). To select the priority method and enter WRR data, complete the following steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Quality of Service > General > Queue. Step 2 Enter the parameters. Queue\u2014Displays the queue number. Scheduling Method\u2014Select one of the following options: Strict Priority\u2014Traffic scheduling for the selected queue and all higher queues is based strictly on the queue priority. WRR\u2014Traffic scheduling for the selected queue is based on WRR. The period time is divided between the WRR queues that aren\u2019t empty, meaning they have descriptors to egress. This division happens only if the strict-priority queues are empty. WRR Weight\u2014If WRR is selected, enter the WRR weight assigned to the queue. % of WRR Bandwidth\u2014Displays the amount of bandwidth assigned to the queue. These values represent the percent of the WRR weight. Step 3 Click Apply. The queues are configured, and the Running Configuration file is updated.",

The following table describes the default mapping when there are 8 queues: 802.1p Values (0-7, 7 being the highest) Queue (8 queues 1-8, 8 is the highest priority) Notes 0 2 Background 1 1 Best Effort 2 3 Excellent Effort 3 4 Critical Application - LVS phone SIP 4 5 Video 5 6 Voice - Cisco IP phone default 6 7 Interwork Control LVS phone RTP 7 8 Network Control By changing the CoS/802.1p to Queue mapping (CoS/802.1p to Queue) and the Queue schedule method and bandwidth allocation, it\u2019s possible to achieve the desired quality of service in a network. The CoS/802.1p to Queue mapping is applicable only if one of the following exists: The device is in QoS Basic mode and CoS/802.1p trusted mode. The device is in QoS Advanced mode and the packets belong to flows that are CoS/802.1p trusted. To map CoS values to egress queues, follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Quality of Service > General > CoS/802.1p to Queue. Step 2 Enter the parameters. 802.1p\u2014Displays the 802.1p priority tag values to be assigned to an egress queue, where 0 is the lowest and 7 is the highest priority. Output Queue\u2014Select the egress queue to which the 802.1p priority is mapped. Either four or eight egress queues are supported, where Queue 4 or Queue 8 is the highest priority egress queue and Queue 1 is the lowest priority. Step 3 For each 802.1p priority, select the Output Queue to which it is mapped. Step 4 Click Apply, Cancel or Restore Defaults. 801.1p priority values to queues are mapped, and the Running Configuration file is updated, the changes that entered are canceled, or previously defined values are restored.",

However, neither the frames nor the community string is encrypted. Therefore, SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 aren\u2019t secure. In SNMPv3, the following security mechanisms can be configured. Authentication\u2014The device checks that the SNMP user is an authorized system administrator. This is done for each frame. Privacy\u2014SNMP frames can carry encrypted data. Thus, in SNMPv3, there are three levels of security: No security (No authentication and no privacy) Authentication (Authentication and no privacy) Authentication and privacy SNMPv3 provides a means of controlling the content each user can read or write and the notifications they receive. A group defines read/write privileges and a level of security. It becomes operational when it\u2019s associated with an SNMP user or community. Note To associate a non-default view with a group, first create the view in the SNMP Views. To create an SNMP group, complete the following steps: Procedure Step 1 Click SNMP > Groups. This page contains the existing SNMP groups and their security levels. Step 2 Click Add. Step 3 Enter the parameters. Group Name\u2014Enter a new group name. Security Model\u2014Select the SNMP version attached to the group, SNMPv1, v2, or v3. Three types of views with various security levels can be defined. For each security level, select the views for Read, Write, and Notify by entering the following fields: Enable\u2014Select this field to enable the Security Level. Security Level\u2014Define the security level attached to the group. SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 support neither authentication nor privacy. If SNMPv3 is selected, choose one of the following: No Authentication and No Privacy\u2014Neither the Authentication nor the Privacy security levels are assigned to the group. Authentication and No Privacy\u2014Authenticates SNMP messages, and ensures that the SNMP message origin is authenticated but doesn\u2019t encrypt them. Authentication and Privacy\u2014Authenticates SNMP messages, and encrypts them. View\u2014Select to associate a view with either read, write, and/or notify access privileges of the group limits the scope of the MIB tree to which the group has read, write, and notify access. Read\u2014Management access is read-only for the selected view. Otherwise, a user or a community associated with this group is able to read all MIBs except those that control SNMP itself. Write\u2014Management access is written for the selected view. Otherwise, a user or a community associated with this group is able to write all MIBs except those that control SNMP itself. Notify\u2014Limits the available content of the traps to those included in the selected view. Otherwise, there\u2019s no restriction on the contents of the traps. Step 4 Click Apply. The SNMP group is saved to the Running Configuration file.",
