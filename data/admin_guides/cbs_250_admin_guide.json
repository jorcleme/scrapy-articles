The PoE switches are PSE (Power Sourcing Equipment) that are capable of supplying DC power to attaching powered devices (PD). These devices include VoIP phones, IP cameras, and wireless access points. The PoE switches can detect and supply power to pre-standard legacy PoE PD. Due to the PoE legacy support, it is possible that a PoE switch acting as a PSE may mistakenly detect and supply power to an attaching PSE, including other PoE switches, as a legacy PD. Even though PoE switches are PSE, and as such should be powered by AC, they could be powered up as a legacy PD by another PSE due to false detection. When this happens, the PoE switch may not operate properly and may not be able to properly supply power to its attaching PDs. To prevent false detection, you should disable PoE on the ports on the PoE switches that are used to connect to PSEs. You should also first power up a PSE device before connecting it to a PoE switch. When a device is being falsely detected as a PD, you should disconnect the device from the PoE port and power recycle the device with AC power before reconnecting its PoE ports.",

Console port with RJ-45 and mini USB connectors. The console connects a serial cable to a computer serial port so that it can be configured using a terminal emulation program. Note Only certain models support this feature. USB Port\u2014The USB port connects the switch to a USB device so that you can save and restore the configuration files, firmware images, and SYSLOG files through the connected USB device. The USB port supports the FAT32 file system. RJ-45 Ethernet Ports\u2014The RJ-45 Ethernet ports connect network devices, such as computers, printers, and access points, to the switch. SFP+ Port (if present)\u2014The small form-factor pluggable plus (SFP+) are connection points for modules so that the switch can link to other switches. These ports are also commonly referred to as mini 10GigaBit Interface Converter ports. The term SFP+ is used in this guide. The SFP+ ports (if present) are compatible with the following Cisco SFP 1G optical modules MGBSX1, MGBLX1, MGBLH1, MGBT1, as well as other brands. The SFP+ ports are compatible with the following Cisco SFP 1G optical modules MGBSX1, MGBLX1, MGBLH1, MGBT1, as well as other brands. The Cisco SFP+ Copper Cable modules that are supported in the Cisco switches are: SFP-H10GB-CU1M, SFP-H10GB-CU3M, and SFP-H10GB-CU5M. The LEDs of the corresponding RJ-45 port flash green to respond to the SFP interface traffic. Small form-factor pluggable (SFP) ports are connection points for modules, so the switch can link to other switches. Some SFP interfaces are shared with one other RJ-45 and SFP+ port, called a combo port. When the SFP is active, the adjacent RJ-45 port is disabled. Reset button is used to reset or reboot the switch. The table below displays the reset behavior on the switch. Press Type New Behavior (Firmware 3.2 and on) Old Behavior (Firmware prior to 3.2) 1- 5 seconds System LED is green, releasing button does not cause reload. Reload 6- 10 seconds System LED flash green, releasing button during this period will cause device reload, but system is not set to factory default. Reload 11-15 seconds System LED is green, releasing button does not cause reload Factory default 16-20 seconds System LED flashes green, releasing button during this period will cause device reload to factory default Factory default > 20 seconds System LED is green, releasing button does not cause reload Factory default Note Stack Behavior The reset button disable setting is applied to all units in the stack, meaning that if configured, the reset button on all units in the stack are disabled, and if not configured the reset button on all units in the stack are enabled. This applies also to units that join an existing stack. OOB Port (if present)\u2014The Out of Band (OOB) port is a CPU Ethernet port that can be used only as a management interface. Bridging between the OOB port and the in-band Layer 2 interface is not supported. This does not appear on 250 devices. Multi-Gigabit Ethernet Ports (if present) \u2014Highlighted in blue, these ports support speeds up to 2.5 Gbps or 5 Gbps on Cat5e cables. The maximum speed supported is printed on the blue shade under the port. Uplink ports on CBS350-8MGP-2X also support multi-Gigabit speed. In this case, port speed can reach 10Gbps. Most of the cabling deployed worldwide is Cat5e, and previously limited to 1 Gbps at 100 meters. Cisco multi-Gigabit Ethernet enables speeds up to 2.5 or 5 Gbps on the same infrastructure without replacing a cable. 60-Watt PoE Ports (if present)- The 60-Watt PoE port doubles the maximum PoE power delivered on the port to 60W.",

The switch uses the factory default IP address of 192.168.1.254, with a subnet of /24. When the switch is using the factory default IP address, the System LED flashes continuously. When the switch is using a DHCP server-assigned IP address or an administrator has configured a static IP address, the System LED is a steady green (DHCP is enabled by default). If you are managing the switch through a network connection and the switch IP address is changed, either by a DHCP server or manually, your access to the switch will be lost. You must enter the new IP address that the switch is using into your browser to use the web-based interface. If you are managing the switch through a console port connection, the link is retained. To configure the switch using the web-based interface: Procedure Step 1 Power on the computer and your switch. Step 2 Connect the computer to any network port. Step 3 Set up the IP configuration on your computer. If the switch is using the default static IP address of 192.168.1.254/24, you must choose an IP address for the computer in the range of 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.253 that is not already in use. If the IP addresses will be assigned by DHCP, make sure that your DHCP server is running and can be reached from the switch and the computer. You may need to disconnect and reconnect the devices for them to discover their new IP addresses from the DHCP server. Note Details on how to change the IP address on your computer depend upon the type of architecture and operating system that you are using. Use your computers local Help and Support functionality and search for \u201cIP Addressing.\u201d Step 4 Open a web browser window. Step 5 Enter the switch IP address in the address bar and press Enter. For example, http:/192.168.1.254. Step 6 When the login page appears, choose the language that you prefer to use in the web-based interface and enter the username and password. The default username is cisco. The default password is cisco. Usernames and passwords are both case sensitive. Step 7 Click Log In. Step 8 If this is the first time that you have logged on with the default username and password, the Change username and Password. Enter a new username and password and confirm. If this is the first time that you have logged on with the default username and password, the Change username and Password page opens Note Please refer to the password complexity rule section in Login Settings before creating a password. Step 9 Click Apply. Caution Make sure that any configuration changes made are saved before exiting from the web-based interface by clicking on the Save icon. Exiting before you save your configuration results in all changes being lost. The Getting Started page opens. You are now ready to configure the switch.

The network analyzer can be a Cisco Switch Probe device or other Remote Monitoring (RMON) probes. Port mirroring is used on a network device to send a copy of network packets, seen on a single device port, multiple device ports, or an entire VLAN, to a network monitoring connection on another port on the device. This is commonly used when monitoring of network traffic, such as for an intrusion-detection system, is required. A network analyzer, connected to the monitoring port, processes the data packets. A packet, which is received on a network port and assigned to a VLAN that is subject to mirroring, is mirrored to the analyzer port even if the packet was eventually trapped or discarded. Packets sent by the device are mirrored when Transmit (Tx) mirroring is activated. Mirroring does not guarantee that all traffic from the source port(s) is received on the analyzer (destination) port. If more data is sent to the analyzer port than it can support, some data might be lost.",

    "page_content": "RMON alarms provide a mechanism for setting thresholds and sampling intervals to generate exception events on counters or any other SNMP object counter maintained by the agent. Both the rising and falling thresholds must be configured in the alarm. After a rising threshold is crossed, no rising events are generated until the companion falling threshold is crossed. After a falling alarm is issued, the next alarm is issued when a rising threshold is crossed. One or more alarms are bound to an event, which indicates the action to be taken when the alarm occurs. Alarm counters can be monitored by either absolute values or changes (delta) in the counter values. To enter RMON alarms, complete the following steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Status and Statistics > RMON > Alarms. All previously defined alarms are displayed. The fields are described in the Add RMON Alarm page below. In addition to those fields, the following field appears: Counter Value\u2014Displays the value of the statistic during the last sampling period. Step 2 Click Add. Step 3 Enter the parameters. Alarm Entry Displays the alarm entry number. Interface Select the type of interface for which RMON statistics are displayed. Counter Name Select the MIB variable that indicates the type of occurrence measured. Sample Type Select the sampling method to generate an alarm. The options are: Absolute\u2014If the threshold is crossed, an alarm is generated. Delta\u2014Subtracts the last sampled value from the current value The difference in the values is compared to the threshold. If the threshold was crossed, an alarm is generated. Rising Threshold Enter the value that triggers the rising threshold alarm. Rising Event Select an event to be performed when a rising event is triggered. Events are configured in the Events. Falling Threshold Enter the value that triggers the falling threshold alarm. Falling Event Select an event to be performed when a falling event is triggered. Startup Alarm Select the first event from which to start generation of alarms. Rising is defined by crossing the threshold from a low-value threshold to a higher-value threshold. Rising Alarm\u2014A rising value triggers the rising threshold alarm. Falling Alarm\u2014A falling value triggers the falling threshold alarm. Rising and Falling\u2014Both rising and falling values trigger the alarm. Interval Enter the alarm interval time in seconds. Owner Enter the name of the user or network management system that receives the alarm. Step 4 Click Apply. The RMON alarm is saved to the Running Configuration file.",

Network time synchronization is critical because every aspect of managing, securing, planning, and debugging a network involves determining when events occur. Without synchronized clocks, accurately correlating log files between devices when tracking security breaches or network usage is impossible. Synchronized time also reduces confusion in shared file systems, as it is important for the modification times to be consistent, regardless of the machine on which the file systems reside. For these reasons, it is important that the time configured on all of the devices on the network is accurate. Real Time Clock Some devices have an internal self-sufficient Real Time Clock (RTC) component that keeps time even when the device is shut down and not connected to a power source. This internal clock is initialized during manufacturing and can be updated by the time features of the device when the software clock is set. When a device with a functional RTC component starts up, the system clock is set to the time and date of the RTC. The RTC component is updated whenever the system clock is changed - either dynamically by the Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP), or manually. Note The device supports SNTP, and when enabled, the device dynamically synchronizes the device time with time from an SNTP server. The device operates only as an SNTP client, and cannot provide time services to other devices.",

    "page_content": "Cisco Business Dashboard helps you monitor and manage your Cisco 100 to 500 Series network with the use of the Cisco Business Dashboard Manager. The Cisco Business Dashboard Manager is an add-on that automatically discovers your network and allows you to configure and monitor all supported Cisco 100 to 500 Series devices such as Cisco switches, routers, and wireless access points. You can view the Cisco Business Dashboard by clicking Request a Demo Cisco Business Dashboard Manager is a distributed application which is comprised of two separate components or applications: one or more Probes referred to as Cisco Business Dashboard Probe and a single Manager called Cisco Business Dashboard Manager. An instance of Cisco Business Dashboard Probe is installed at each site in the network, performs network discovery and communicates directly with each Cisco device. Note For detailed instructions on how to setup the Cisco Business Dashboard Manager and Probe, please consult the Cisco Business Dashboard Quick Start Guide. https:/cisco.com/go/cbd-docs Complete the following steps on the switch graphical user interface (GUI) to enable a Probe connection to a Dashboard, configure the Organization and Network name, and other information required to allow connection to the Dashboard: Procedure Step 1 Click Administration > Cisco Business Dashboard Settings. Step 2 Configure the following: Probe Operation Check to enable the Cisco Business Dashboard Probe operation. Probe Status Displays the status of the CBD probe. Possible value are Active, Inactive or Fault. If the probe status is Active then alongside the probe status \"Active\" the probe mode will also be displayed as follows: Active (Probe Managed) - The Probe performs network discovery and communicates directly with each managed device on behalf of the Dashboard. In one network you should only enable one Probe. Active (Direct Managed) - Direct managed devices will discover other devices in the broader network and connect those devices to the Dashboard automatically then those devices become manageable. You may optionally have the dashboard explicitly search the IP address ranges to discover network devices, which can be in other VLANs or subnets. Direct managed network is recommended if all your devices support direct management. Probe Version Displays the version of the Cisco Business Dashboard probe. Logging Threshold Select one of the following options (Information, Debug, Warning, or Error) from the drop-down list to limit the level of messages logged by the Cisco Business Dashboard probe agent. Only messages with the specified level or higher will be logged. All Module Logging Check to enable. This logs all communication and events between all modules. Call Home Logging Check to enable. This logs all communication between the Probe and Manger. Discovery Logging Check to enable. This logs the device discovery events and topology discovery. Services Logging Check to enable. This logs the message translation between northbound and southbound. System Logging Check to enable. This logs the core system process not covered by any of the other logs. Northbound Logging Check to enable. This logs the communication between the Manager and the Probe. Southbound Logging Check to enable. This logs the low level communication between the Probe and devices. Dashboard Connection Check to enable connection. Dashboard Status Displays the status (Connected or Disconnected) of the Cisco Business Dashboard Manager. If the Dashboard Status is \"Disconnected\" an error reason will be displayed. Here are some examples: Certificate-error- unspecified certificate verification error Certificate-error- certificate is not yet valid Certificate-error- certificate has expired Certificate-error- certificate verify failed Connection-error- Host not found (authoritative) Connection-error- No route to host Dashboard Definition Define the address of the Cisco Business Dashboard. Select one of the following: By IP address- this option requires you to enter a valid IP address to the IP Address/Name field. By Name- this option requires you to enter a host name to the IP Address/Name field. IP Address/Name Enter the name or IP address of the Cisco Business Dashboard. Dashboard Port Specify one of the following TCP ports to connect to the Dashboard. Use Default (443). User Defined (Range: 1-65535). This option is available only if a valid address is entered in the Dashboard Address field. Connection Setup Specify one of the following connection setups: Online with Web Browser Offline with Access Key Access Key ID The Access Key ID field consists of 24 hexadecimal digits. Note that the field should only allow the input of hexadecimal characters. Access Key Secret Specify the secret to use for authentication. It can be Encrypted or in Plaintext format. The Plaintext format is specified as an alphanumeric string without white-spaces (up to 160 chars). The Key ID and Secret settings must be set together. Note When applying, if the Key ID field is empty and the Secret field is not, or if the Secret field is empty and the Key ID field is not, the following error message is displayed: \u201cKey ID and Secret must be set together\u201d. Step 3 Click Apply to save the setting to the running configuration. Note The fields Organization Name, Network Name, Dashboard Address, Key ID cannot be modified if Dashboard Connection setting is enabled.

Reset Connection - click to disconnect the current connection with the Dashboard, flush the Cisco Business Dashboard Probe cached data, and then attempt to reconnect to the Dashboard. A confirmation message is displayed before the operation starts. This control is enabled only if the Dashboard Connection and Probe Operation are enabled. Note The Reset Connection is only enabled if the Dashboard Connection and Probe Operation check boxes are checked. Clear Probe Database- Click to clear the probe data. It is enabled only if the Probe Operation checkbox is unchecked (and has been unchecked since the screen loaded). Otherwise, the button is disabled with the following tooltip: \u201cProbe Operation must be disabled prior to clearing probe database\u201d. Note Many factors affect the number of network devices and clients that the Cisco Business Dashboard Probe on a switch can manage. We recommend that a probe on a switch manage no more than 15 network devices (switches, routers, and wireless access points) and no more than 150 connected clients. If your network is more complex, we recommend that you use other platforms for the Cisco Business Dashboard Probe.

    "page_content": "Installation of new networking devices or replacement of devices can be expensive, time-consuming and error-prone when performed manually. Typically, new devices are first sent to a central staging facility where the devices are unboxed, connected to a staging network, updated with the right licenses, configurations and images; then packaged and shipped to the actual installation location. After these processes are completed, experts must travel to the installation locations to perform the installation. Even in scenarios where the devices are installed in the NOC/Data Center itself, there may not be enough experts for the sheer number of devices. All these issues contribute to delays in deployment and add to the operational costs. Connecting to PNP Server To allow the switch to connect to the PnP server, a discovery process takes place, in which the switch discovers the PNP server address/url. There are multiple discovery methods, and they are executed by the switch according to the sequence detailed below. If a PnP server is discovered by a certain method, the discovery process is completed and the rest of the methods are not executed: User configured address- the PnP server URL or IP address are specified by the user. Address received from DHCP response option 43- the PnP server URL or IP address are received as part of option 43 in the DHCP response DNS resolution of host name \"pnpserver\"- the PnP server IP addressed is obtained via DNS server resolution of host name \u201cpnpserver\u201d. Cisco Plug and Play Connect - a redirection service that allows full \u201cout of the box\u201d PNP server discovery which runs over HTTPs. The switch contacts the redirection service using the FQDN \u201cdevicehelper.cisco.com\u201d. Cisco PnP Connect Prerequisites To allow Cisco Plug and Play Connect operation, the user needs to create devices and controller profiles in Plug and Play Connect (navigate to https:/software.cisco.com and click the PnP Connect link). Note that a Cisco Smart Account is required to use PnP Connect. To create or update a Smart Account, see the Administration section of https:/software.cisco.com. In addition, the following prerequisites are required to be met on the switch itself: The PNP server was not discovered by the other discovery methods The device is able to successfully resolve the name devicehelper.cisco.com (either static configuration or using DNS server) System time was set using one of the following methods Time was updated by an SNTP server Clock was set manually by user Time was preserved across resets by Real Time Clock (RTC). CA-Signed Certificate based Authentication Cisco distributes certificates signed by a signing authorities in .tar file format and signs the bundle with Cisco Certificate Authority (CA) signature. This certificate bundle is provided by Cisco infoSec for public downloads on cisco.com. Note If the PNP server discovery is based on Cisco PnP Connect, the trust-pool is downloaded from following: http:/www.cisco.com/security/pki/trs/ios_core.p7b. If the PNP server discovery is based on DHCP option 43, use the \u201cT<Trust pool CA bundle URL>;\u201d parameter in DHCP option 43 to provide the URL for downloading the trust pool. The certificates from this bundle can be installed on the Cisco device for server-side validation during SSL handshake. It is assumed that the server uses a certificate, which is signed by one of the CA that is available in the bundle. The PnP agent uses the built-in PKI capability to validate the certificate bundle. As the bundle is signed by Cisco CA, the agent is capable of identifying a bundle that is tampered before installing the certificates on the device. After the integrity of the bundle is ensured by the agent, the agent installs the certificates on the device. After the certificates are installed on the device, the PnP agent initiates an HTTPs connection to the server without any additional steps from the server. Note The device also supports a built in certificate bundle which is installed as part of the bootup process. this bundle can be used to validate PNP server. If a Bundle is downloaded based on Cisco PnP Connect information then the certificates from the downloaded bundle are installed and the certificates based on the built in bundle are un-installed. Note In addition to validating PNP certificate based on installed CA certificate the PNP Agent also validates that the certificate's Common Name/Subject Alternate Name (CN/SAN) matches the host name/IP address of the PNP server. If they don't match validation of certificate is rejected. Cisco PnP DHCP Option 43 Usage Guidelines DHCP option 43 is a vendor specific identifier which is one of the methods that can be used by the PnP agent to locate and connect to the PnP server (see Cisco Plug-n-Play for more information). The following provides Information on configuration of Option 43 to allow proper configuration on DHCP server. Option 43 includes the following fields/parameters: <DHCP-typecode><feature-opcode><version><debug-option>;<arglist> The <arglist> parameter should use the following syntax: B<IP address type>;I<IP address>;J<Port>;K<Transport protocol>;T<Trust pool CA bundle URL>;Z<SNTP server IP address> The following table details the description and usage of option 43 fields Parameter Description DHCP-typecode DHCP sub-option type. The DHCP sub-option type for PnP is 5. Feature-opcode Feature operation code \u2013 can be either Active (A) or Passive (P). The feature operation code for PnP is Active (A) which implies that PnP agent initiates a connection to the PnP server. If the PnP server cannot be reached, PnP agent retries until it makes a connection. Version Version of template to be used by PnP agent. Must be 1. Debug-option Turns ON or OFF the debug messages during the processing of the DHCP Option 43: D \u2013 debug option is ON; N \u2013 debug option is OFF. K Transport protocol to be used between PnP agent and PnP server: 4 - HTTP or 5 \u2013 HTTPS. B IP address type of PnP server IP address specified with the letter code \u2018I\u2019: 1- host, 2- IPv4, 3- IPv6 I IP address or host name of PnP server. If host name is specified, DNS related options must be present in the DHCP server to allow for successful use of host name. T URL of trust pool CA bundle. You can get the CA bundle from a Cisco Business Dashboard, or from a TFTP server. When using Cisco Business Dashboard, use the following URL format: http:/CBD IP address or domain name/ca/trustpool/CA_bundle_name When using TFTP Server, use the following URL format: tftp:/tftp server IP/CA_bundle_name Z SNTP server IP address. You must sync the clock before configuring a trust pool. Note The switch clock is considered synchronized if it was updated by any SNTP server supported by the switch (by default, user configured or in Z parameter) or set manually by the user. This parameter is required when using trust pool security if the switch can not reach any other SNTP server. For example, for an out-of-the box switch with factory default configuration but no Internet connectivity to reach the default SNTP servers. J Port number HTTP=80 HTTPS=443 Examples for Option 43 usage: The following format is used for PnP connection setup using HTTP: option 43 ascii 5A1N;K4;B2;I10.10.10.3;J80 The following format is used for PnP connection setup on top of HTTPS, directly using a trust pool. HTTPS can be used when the trust pool CA bundle is downloaded from a Cisco Business Dashboard and the Cisco Business Dashboard server certificate was issued by a 3rd party (not self signed). In the example below \u201c10.10.10.3\u201d is the Cisco Business Dashboard IP address. Optionally, you can specify a domain name: option 43 ascii 5A1N;K5;B2;I10.10.10.3;Thttp:/10.10.10.3/ca/trustpool/ios.p7b;Z10.75.166.1",

Cisco Discovery Protocol is enabled by default. Each device configured for Cisco Discovery Protocol advertises at least one address at which the device can receive messages and sends periodic advertisements (messages) to the well-known multicast address 01:00:0C:CC:CC:CC. Devices discover each other by listening at that address. They also listen to messages to learn when interfaces on other devices are up or go down. Advertisements contain time-to-live information, which indicates the length of time a receiving device should hold Cisco Discovery Protocol information before discarding it. Advertisements supported and configured in Cisco software are sent, by default, every 60 seconds on interfaces that support Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAP) headers. Cisco devices never forward Cisco Discovery Protocol packets. Cisco devices that support Cisco Discovery Protocol store the information received in a table. Information in this table is refreshed every time an advertisement is received, and information about a device is discarded after three advertisements from that device are missed.

    "page_content": "A PoE device is Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE) that delivers electrical power to a connected Pod Devices (PD) over existing copper cables without interfering with the network traffic, updating the physical network or modifying the network infrastructure. PoE provides the following features: Eliminates the need to run 110/220 V AC power to all devices on a wired LAN. Eliminates the need to deploy double cabling systems in an enterprise significantly decreasing installation costs. Power over Ethernet can be used in any enterprise network that deploys relatively low-pod devices connected to the Ethernet LAN, such as: IP phones, Wireless access points, IP gateways, Audio and video remote monitoring devices. PoE implements in the following stages: Detection\u2014Sends special pulses on the copper cable. When a PoE device is located at the other end, that device responds to these pulses. Classification\u2014Negotiation between the Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE) and the Pod Device (PD) commences after the Detection stage. During negotiation, the PD specifies its class, which indicates maximum amount of power that the PD consumes. Power Consumption\u2014After the classification stage completes, the PSE provides power to the PD. If the PD supports PoE, but without classification, it is assumed to be class 0 (the maximum). If a PD tries to consume more power than permitted by the standard, the PSE stops supplying power to the port. PoE supports two modes: Port Limit\u2014The maximum power the device agrees to supply is limited to the value the system administrator configures, regardless of the Classification result. Class Power Limit\u2014The maximum power the device agrees to supply is determined by the results of the Classification stage. This means that it is set as per the Client's request. Warning The PoE unit is to be connected only to PoE networks without routing to the outside plant.",

Green Ethernet is different from EEE in that Green Ethernet energy-detect is enabled on all devices whereas only Gigabyte ports are enabled with EEE. The Green Ethernet feature can reduce overall power usage in the following ways: Energy-Detect Mode\u2014On an inactive link, the port moves into inactive mode, saving power while keeping the administrative status of the port Up. Recovery from this mode to full operational mode is fast, transparent, and no frames are lost. This mode is supported on both GE and FE ports. This mode is disabled by default. Short-Reach Mode\u2014This feature provides for power savings on a short length of cable. After cable length is analyzed, the power usage is adjusted for various cable lengths. If the cable is shorter than 30 meter for 10 gigabit ports and 50 meter for other type of ports, the device uses less power to send frames over the cable, thus saving energy. This mode is only supported on RJ45 ports; it does not apply to Combo ports. This mode is disabled by default. In addition to the above Green Ethernet features, the 802.3az Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) is found on devices supporting GE ports. EEE reduces power consumption when there is no traffic on the port. EEE is enabled globally by default. Power savings, current power consumption and cumulative energy saved can be monitored. The total amount of saved energy can be viewed as a percentage of the power that would have been consumed by the physical interfaces had they not been running in Green Ethernet mode. The saved energy displayed is only related to Green Ethernet. The amount of energy saved by EEE is not displayed.",

Note If you have a 3.0.0.69 (or earlier) firmware version and you upgrade to the latest (March 2021) 3.1 version (or later when available), the default setting will remain with the Smartport feature enabled. If you purchase a switch that has the 3.1 firmware version (or later), the firmware will have the Smartport feature disabled by default. This change was made because some customers didn\u2019t necessarily want to use the Smartport feature or it was causing an issue with connectivity and customers didn\u2019t realize it was enabled. To configure the Smartport feature, follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Smartport > Properties. Step 2 Enter the parameters. Administrative Auto Smartport-Select to enable or disable Auto Smartport. The following options are available: Disable-Select to disable Auto Smartport on the device. this is the default setting. Enable-Select to enable Auto Smartport on the device. Enable by Auto Voice VLAN-This enables the Auto Smartport, but is enabled only when Auto Voice VLAN is on. Operational Auto Smartport-Displays the Auto Smartport status. Auto Smartport Device Detection Method-Select whether incoming CDP, LLDP, or both types of packets are used to detect the Smartport type of the attaching devices. At least one must be checked for Auto Smartport to identify devices. Operational CDP Status-Displays the operational status of CDP. Enable CDP if Auto Smartport is to detect the Smartport type based on CDP advertisement. Operational LLDP Status-Displays the operational status of LLDP. Enable LLDP if Auto Smartport is to detect the Smartport type based on LLDP/LLDP-MED advertisement. Auto Smartport Device Detection-Select each type of device for which Auto Smartport can assign Smartport types to interfaces. If unchecked, Auto Smartport doesn\u2019t assign that Smartport type to any interface. Step 3 Click Apply. This sets the global Smartport parameters on the device.",

Enable Auto Smartport on an interface. Diagnose a Smartport macro that failed upon application, and caused the Smartport type to become Unknown. Reapply a Smartport macro to an interface. In some circumstances, you may want to reapply a Smartport macro so that the configuration at an interface is up to date. For instance, reapplying a switch Smartport macro at a device interface makes the interface a member of the VLANs created since the last macro application. Reset unknown interfaces, to set them to Default. To apply a Smartport macro, follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Smartport > Interface Settings. To reapply the Smartport macros associated with a group of interfaces, select from the following and click Apply: All Switches, Routers, and Wireless Access Points\u2014Reapplies the macros to all interfaces. All Switches\u2014Reapplies the macros to all interfaces defined as switches. All Routers\u2014Reapplies the macros to all interfaces defined as routers. All Wireless Access Points\u2014Reapplies the macros to all interfaces defined as access points. To reapply the Smartport macros associated with an interface, select the interface and click Reapply. The Reapply action also adds the interface to all newly created VLANs. Step 2 Smartport Diagnostic. If a Smartport macro fails, the Smartport Type of the interface is Unknown. Select an interface which is of unknown type and click Show Diagnostic. This displays the command at which application of the macro failed. Step 3 Resetting all Unknown interfaces to Default type. Select the Smartport Type equals to checkbox. Select Unknown. Click Go. Click Reset All Unknown Smartports. Then reapply the macro as described above. This performs a reset on all interfaces with type Unknown, meaning that all interfaces are returned to the Default type. Step 4 Select an interface and click Edit. Step 5 Enter the fields. Interface\u2014Select the port or LAG. Smartport Type\u2014Displays the Smartport type currently assigned to the port/LAG. Smartport Application\u2014Select the Smartport type from the Smartport Application pull-down. Smartport Application Method\u2014If Auto Smartport is selected, Auto Smartport automatically assigns the Smartport type based on the CDP and/or LLDP advertisement received from the connecting devices and applying the corresponding Smartport macro. To statically assign a Smartport type and apply the corresponding Smartport macro to the interface, select the desired Smartport type. Persistent Status\u2014Select to enable the Persistent status.

When the switch is connected to an IP Phone, the phone sends voice traffic with Layer 3 IP precedence and Layer 2 class of service (CoS) values, which are both set to 5 by default. Because the sound quality of an IP phone call can deteriorate if the data is unevenly sent, the switch supports quality of service (QoS) based on IEEE 802.1p CoS. QoS uses classification and scheduling to send network traffic from the switch in a predictable manner. Voice VLAN can propagate the CoS/802.1p and DSCP settings by using LLDP-MED Network policies. The LLDP-MED is set by default to response with the Voice QoS setting if an appliance sends LLDP-MED packets. MED-supported devices must send their voice traffic with the same CoS/802.1p and DSCP values, as received with the LLDP-MED response.You can disable the automatic update between Voice VLAN and LLDP-MED and use your own network polic ies. Working with the OUI mode, the device can additionally configure the mapping and remarking (CoS/802.1p) of the voice traffic based on the OUI. By default, all interfaces are CoS/802.1p trusted.

For example, while port A is blocked in one STP instance due to a loop on VLAN A, the same port can be placed in the Forwarding State in another STP instance. The MSTP Properties page enables you to define the global MSTP settings. Multiple STP (MSTP) - MSTP is based on RSTP. It detects Layer 2 loops, and attempts to mitigate them by preventing the involved port from transmitting traffic. Since loops exist on a per-Layer 2-domain basis, a situation can occur when a port is blocked to eliminate a STP loop. Traffic will be forwarded to the port that is not blocked, and no traffic will be forwarded to the port that is blocked. This is not an efficient usage of bandwidth as the blocked port will always be unused. MSTP solves this problem by enabling several STP instances, so that it is possible to detect and mitigate loops separately in each instance. This enables a port to be blocked for one or more STP instances but non blocked for other STP instances. If different VLANs are associated with different STP instances, then their traffic will be relayed based on the STP port state of their associated MST instances. Better bandwidth utilization results.",

MSTP enables formation of MST regions that can run multiple MST instances (MSTI). Multiple regions and other STP bridges are interconnected using one single common spanning tree (CST). MSTP is fully compatible with RSTP bridges, in that an MSTP BPDU can be interpreted by an RSTP bridge as an RSTP BPDU. This not only enables compatibility with RSTP bridges without configuration changes, but also causes any RSTP bridges outside of an MSTP region to see the region as a single RSTP bridge, regardless of the number of MSTP bridges inside the region itself. For two or more switches to be in the same MST region, they must have the same VLANs to MST instance mapping, configuration revision number, and region name. Switches intended to be in the same MST region are never separated by switches from another MST region. If they are separated, the region becomes two separate regions.

    "page_content": "Multicast forwarding enables one-to-many information dissemination. Multicast applications are useful for dissemination of information to multiple clients, where clients do not require reception of the entire content. A typical application is a cable-TV-like service, where clients can join a channel in the middle of a transmission, and leave before it ends. The data is sent only to relevant ports. Forwarding the data only to the relevant ports conserves bandwidth and host resources on links. By default, all Multicast frames are flooded to all ports of the VLAN. It is possible to selectively forward only to relevant ports and filter (drop) the Multicast on the rest of the ports by enabling the Bridge Multicast filtering status in this section. Multicast addresses have the following properties: Each IPv4 Multicast address is in the address range 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255. The IPv6 Multicast address is FF00:/8. To map an IP Multicast group address to an Layer 2 Multicast address: For IPv4, this is mapped by taking the 23 low-order bits from the IPv4 address, and adding them to the 01:00:5e prefix. By standard, the upper nine bits of the IP address are ignored, and any IP addresses that only differ in the value of these upper bits are mapped to the same Layer 2 address, since the lower 23 bits that are used are identical. For example, 234.129.2.3 is mapped to a MAC Multicast group address 01:00:5e:01:02:03. Up to 32 IP Multicast group addresses can be mapped to the same Layer 2 address. For IPv6, this is mapped by taking the 32 low-order bits of the Multicast address, and adding the prefix of 33:33. For example, the IPv6 Multicast address FF00:1122:3344 is mapped to Layer 2 Multicast 33:33:11:22:33:44. To enable Multicast filtering, and select the forwarding method, follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Multicast > Properties. Step 2 Enter the parameters. Bridge Multicast Filtering Status Select to enable filtering. VLAN ID Select the VLAN ID to set its forwarding method.

    "page_content": "A multicast address is a single IP data packet set that represents a network host group. Multicast addresses are available to process datagrams or frames intended to be multicast to a designated network service. Multicast addressing is applied in the link layer (Layer 2 of the OSI Model) and the Internet layer (Layer 3 of the OSI Model) for IP versions 4 (IPv4) and 6 (IPv6). Multicast addresses in IPV4 are defined using leading address bits of 1110, which originate from the classful network design of the early Internet when this group of addresses was designated as Class D. IPv4 multicast packets are delivered using the Ethernet MAC address range 01:00:5e:00:00:00\u201301:00:5e:7f:ff:ff. This range has 23 bits of available address space. The first octet (01) includes the broadcast/multicast bit. The lower 23 bits of the 28-bit multicast IP address are mapped into the 23 bits of available Ethernet address space. This means that there is ambiguity in delivering packets. If two hosts on the same subnet each subscribe to a different multicast group whose address differs only in the first 5 bits, Ethernet packets for both multicast groups will be delivered to both hosts, requiring the network software in the hosts to discard the unrequired packets.

This section provides information for defining the device IPv4 addresses, either manually or by making the device a DHCP client. The IPv4 Interface page is used to configure IP addresses for device management. This IP address can be configured on a port, a LAG, VLAN, loopback interface or out-of-band interface. You can configure multiple IP addresses (interfaces) on the device. It then supports traffic routing between these various interfaces and also to remote networks. By default and typically, the routing functionality is performed by the hardware. If hardware resources are exhausted or there\u2019s a routing table overflow in the hardware, IP routing is performed by the software. Note The device software consumes one VLAN ID (VID) for every IP address configured on a port or LAG. The device takes the first VID that isn\u2019t used starting from 4094. To configure the IPv4 addresses, follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click IPv4 Configuration > IPv4 Interface.

Relay agents are used to forward requests and replies between clients and servers when they are not on the same physical subnet. Relay agent forwarding is distinct from the normal forwarding of an IP router, where IP datagrams are switched between networks somewhat transparently. By contrast, relay agents receive DHCP messages and then generate a new DHCP message to send on another interface.",

    "page_content": "The Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a network-layer protocol for packet-switched internetworks. IPv6 was designed to replace IPv4, the predominantly deployed Internet protocol. IPv6 introduces greater flexibility in assigning IP addresses, because the address size increases from 32-bit to 128-bit addresses. IPv6 addresses are written as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, for example FE80:0000:0000:0000:0000:9C00:876A:130B. The abbreviated form, in which a group of zeroes can be left out, and replaced with ':', is also acceptable, for example, FE80:9C00:876A:130B. IPv6 interface addresses can be configured manually by the user, or automatically configured by a DHCP server. This section provides information for defining the device IPv6 addresses, either manually or by making the device a DHCP client. To define IPv6 global parameters and DHCPv6 client settings, follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click IPv6 Configuration > IPv6 Global Configuration. Step 2 Enter values for the following fields: IPv6 Routing\u2014Select to enable IPv6 routing. If this isn\u2019t enabled, the device acts as a host (not a router) and can receive management packets, but can\u2019t forward packets. If routing is enabled, the device can forward the IPv6 packets. Enabling IPv6 routing removes any address previously assigned to the device interface, via the auto-config operation, from an RA sent by a Router in the network. ICMPv6 Rate Limit Interval\u2014Enter how often the ICMP error messages are generated. ICMPv6 Rate Limit Bucket Size\u2014Enter the maximum number of ICMP error messages that can be sent by the device per interval. IPv6 Hop Limit\u2014Enter the maximum number of intermediate routers on its way to the final destination to which a packet can pass. Each time a packet is forwarded to another router, the hop limit is reduced. When the hop limit becomes zero, the packet is discarded. This prevents packets from being transferred endlessly. DHCPv6 Client Settings Unique Identifier (DUID) Format\u2014This is the identifier of the DHCP client that is used by the DHCP server to locate the client. It can be in one of the following formats: Link-Layer\u2014(Default). If you select this option, the MAC address of the device is used. Enterprise Number\u2014If you select this option, enter the following fields. Enterprise Number\u2014The vendors registered Private Enterprise number as maintained by IANA. Identifier\u2014The vendor-defined hex string (up to 64 hex characters) If the number of the character isn\u2019t even, a zero is added at the right. Each 2 hex characters can be separated by a period or colon. DHCPv6 Unique Identifier (DUID)\u2014Displays the identifier selected. Step 3 Click Apply. The IPv6 global parameters and DHCPv6 client settings are updated.",

Because the address size increases from 32-bit to 128-bit, IPv6 allows for greater flexibility in assigning IP addresses.IPv6 addresses are composed of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, such as FE80:0000:0000:0000:0000:9C00:876A:130B. To communicate with other IPv6 nodes over an IPv4-only network, IPv6 nodes require an intermediary mapping mechanism. This mechanism, known as a tunnel, allows IPv6-only hosts to access IPv4 services and isolated IPv6 hosts and networks to connect to an IPv6 node via the IPv4 infrastructure. An IPv6 interface can be configured on a port, LAG, VLAN, loopback interface or tunnel. To define an IPv6 interface, follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click IPv6 Configuration > IPv6 Interfaces. Step 2 Enter the parameters. IPv6 Link Local Default Zone\u2014Select to enable defining a default zone. This is an interface to be used to egress a link-local packet arriving without a specified interface or with its default zone 0. IPv6 Link Local Default Zone Interface\u2014Select an interface to be used as a default zone. This can be a previously defined tunnel or other interface. Step 3 Click Apply to configure default zone. The IPv6 Interface Table is displayed along with the following field: Tunnel Type\u2014Manual, 6\u20134 and ISATAP. Step 4 Click Add to add a new interface on which interface IPv6 is enabled. Step 5 Enter the fields: IPv6 Interface\u2014Select a specific port, LAG, loopback interface or VLAN for the IPv6 address. Step 6 To configure the interface as a DHCPv6 client, meaning to enable the interface to receive information from the DHCPv6 server, such as: SNTP configuration and DNS information, enter the DHCPv6 Client fields: DHCPv6 Client\u2014Select to enable DHCPv6 Client (stateless and stateful) on the interface. Rapid Commit\u2014Select to enable the use of the two-message exchange for address allocation and other configuration. If it\u2019s enabled, the client includes the rapid-commit option in a solicit message. Minimum Information Refresh Time\u2014This value is used to put a floor on the refresh time value. If the server sends a refresh time option that is less than this value, this value is used instead. Select Infinite or User Defined to set a value. Information Refresh Time\u2014This value indicates how often the device refreshes information received from the DHCPv6 server. If this option isn\u2019t received from the server, the value entered here is used. Select Infinite or User Defined to set a value. Step 7 To configure additional IPv6 parameters, enter the following fields: IPv6 Address Auto Configuration\u2014Select to enable automatic address configuration from router advertisements sent by neighbors. Number of DAD Attempts\u2014Enter the number of consecutive neighbor solicitation messages that are sent while Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) is performed on the interface\u2019s Unicast IPv6 addresses. DAD verifies the uniqueness of a new Unicast IPv6 address before it\u2019s assigned. New addresses remain in a tentative state during DAD verification. Entering 0 in this field disables duplicate address detection processing on the specified interface. Entering 1 in this field indicates a single transmission without follow-up transmissions. Send ICMPv6 Messages\u2014Enable generating unreachable destination messages. IPv6 Redirects\u2014Select to enable sending ICMP IPv6 redirect messages. These messages inform other devices not to send traffic to the device, but rather to another device. Step 8 Click Apply to enable IPv6 processing on the selected interface. Regular IPv6 interfaces have the following addresses automatically configured: Link local address using EUI-64 format interface ID based on a device's MAC address All node link local Multicast addresses (FF02:1) Solicited-Node Multicast address (format FF02:1:FFXX:X) Step 9 Select an Interface and click Restart to initiate a refresh of the stateless information received from the DHCPv6 server. Step 10 Select an interface and click Details to display the information received on the interface from a DHCPv6 server.

    "page_content": "Tunnels enable transmission of IPv6 packets over IPv4 networks. Each tunnel has a source IPv4 address and if it\u2019s a manual tunnel it also has a destination IPv4 address. The IPv6 packet is encapsulated between these addresses. ISATAP Tunnels The device supports a single Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) tunnel. An ISATAP tunnel is a point-to-multi-point tunnel. The source address is the IPv4 address (or one of the IPv4 addresses) of the device. When configuring an ISATAP tunnel, the destination IPv4 address is provided by the router. Note that: An IPv6 link local address is assigned to the ISATAP interface. The initial IP address is assigned to the interface, which is then activated. If an ISATAP interface is active, the ISATAP router IPv4 address is resolved via DNS by using ISATAP-to-IPv4 mapping. If the ISATAP DNS record is not resolved, ISATAP host name-to-address mapping is searched in the host mapping table When the ISATAP router IPv4 address is not resolved via the DNS process, the ISATAP IP interface remains active. The system does not have a default router for ISATAP traffic until the DNS process is resolved. Additional Types of Tunnels The following additional types of tunnels can be configured on the device: Manual Tunnel An IPv6 link local address is assigned to the ISATAP interface. The initial IP address is assigned to the interface, which is then activated If an ISATAP interface is active, the ISATAP router IPv4 address is resolved via DNS by using ISATAP-to-IPv4 mapping. If the ISATAP DNS record is not resolved, ISATAP host name-to-address mapping is searched in the host mapping table. When the ISATAP router IPv4 address is not resolved via the DNS process, the ISATAP IP interface remains active. The system does not have a default router for ISATAP traffic until the DNS process is resolved. This is a point-to-point definition. When creating a manual tunnel, you enter both the source IP address (one of the device\u2019s IP addresses) and the destination IPv4 address. 6 to 4 Tunnel 6 to 4 is an automatic tunneling mechanism that uses the underlying IPv4 network as a non-Broadcast multiple-access link layer for IPv6. Only one 6 to 4 tunnel is supported on a device. The 6 to 4 tunnel is supported only when IPv6 Forwarding is supported. IPv6 Multicast is not supported on the 6to4 tunnel interface The switch automatically creates a 2002:/16 on-link prefix on the 6to4 tunnel. The connected 2002:/16 route on the tunnel is added to the Routing Table as result of the on-link prefix creation When the tunnel mode is changed from 6to4 to another mode, the on-link prefix and connected routes are removed. When the next hop outgoing interface is the 6to4 tunnel, the IPv4 address of the next hop node is taken from the prefix 2002:WWXX:YYZZ:/48 of the IPv6 next hop IPv6 address, if it is global, and from the last 32 bits of the interface identifier of the IPv6next hop IPv6 address, if it is link local. The following table summarizes tunnel support in the various devices: Tunnel Type CBS350 CBS350 Stacking ISATAP Supported Supported Manual Not Supported Not Supported Automatic 6to4 tunnel Not Supported Not Supported To configure an IPv6 tunnel follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click IPv6 Configuration >IPv6 Tunnel. Step 2 Click Create ISATAP Tunnel. Step 3 The Tunnel Number (1) and its Tunnel Type (ISATAP) are displayed. Step 4 Enter the following fields Source IPv4 Address\u2014Set the local (source) IPv4 address of a tunnel interface. The IPv4 address of the selected IPv4 interface is used to form part of the IPv6 address over the ISATAP tunnel interface. The IPv6 address has a 64-bit network prefix of fe80:, with the rest of the 64-bit formed by concatenating 0000:5EFE and the IPv4 address. Auto\u2014Automatically selects the lowest IPv4 address from among all of its configured IPv4 interfaces as the source address for packets sent on the tunnel interface. Manual\u2014Specifies the IPv4 address to use as the source address for packets sent on the tunnel interface. The local address of the tunnel interface is not changed when the IPv4 address is moved to another interface. Note If the device IPv4 address is changed, the local address of the tunnel interface is also changed Interface\u2014Specifies the interface ISATAP Router Name\u2014 Select one of the following options to configure a global string that represents a specific automatic tunnel router domain name. Use Default\u2014This is always ISATAP. User Defined\u2014Enter the router\u2019s domain name. Step 5 Enter the parameters: ISATAP Solicitation Interval\u2014The number of seconds between ISATAP router solicitations messages, when no active ISATAP router is discovered. The interval can be the Default Value or a User Defined interval. ISATAP Robustness\u2014Used to calculate the interval for router solicitation queries. The bigger the number, the more frequent the queries. The interval can be the Default Value or a User Defined interval .

This argument must be in the form documented in RFC 4293 where the address is specified in hexadecimal\u2014using 16-bit values between colons. Prefix Length The length of the IPv6 prefix. A decimal value that indicates how many of the high-order contiguous bits of the address comprise the prefix (the network portion of the address). A slash mark must precede the decimal value. Prefix Advertisement Select to advertise this prefix. Valid Lifetime The remaining length of time, in seconds, that this prefix will continue to be valid, i.e., time until invalidation. The address generated from an invalidated prefix should not appear as the destination or source address of a packet. Infinite\u2014Select this value to set the field to 4,294,967,295, which represents infinity. User Defined\u2014Enter a value. Preferred Lifetime The remaining length of time, in seconds, that this prefix will continue to be preferred. After this time has passed, the prefix should no longer be used as a source address in new communications, but packets received on such an interface are processed as expected. The preferred-lifetime must not be larger than the valid-lifetime. Infinite\u2014Select this value to set the field to 4,294,967,295, which represents infinity. User Defined\u2014Enter a value. Auto Configuration Enable automatic configuration of IPv6 addresses using stateless auto configuration on an interface and enable IPv6 processing on the interface. Addresses are configured depending on the prefixes received in Router Advertisement messages. Prefix Status Select one of the following options: Onlink\u2014Configures the specified prefix as on-link. Nodes sending traffic to addresses that contain the specified prefix consider the destination to be locally reachable on the link. An onlink prefix is inserted into the routing table as a connected prefix (L-bit set). No-Onlink\u2014Configures the specified prefix as not onlink. A no onlink prefix is inserted into the routing table as a connected prefix but advertised with a L-bit clear. Offlink\u2014Configures the specified prefix as offlink. The prefix will be advertised with the L-bit clear. The prefix will not be inserted into the routing table as a connected prefix. If the prefix is already present in the routing table as a connected prefix (for example, because the prefix was also configured by adding an IPv6 address), it will be removed. Step 6 Click Apply to save the configuration to the Running Configuration file.",

A dictionary attack is an automated process to attempt to login by attempting thousands, or even millions, of credentials. The purpose of a dictionary attack is to actually gain management access to the device. To prevent these attacks the device can be configured to limit the amount of login attempts allowed within a specific time range and by defining a quiet mode period following a specified number of failed attempts. If the specified number of connection attempts fails (attempt tries) within a specified time (within seconds), the device will not accept any additional login attempts for a specified period of time (block-for seconds). This can also occur when the user forgets his login credentials and tries to login several times resulting in login failure. Note Following a specified number of failed login attempts over a specified time period, the device will enter into quiet mode. The device will not accept any more connection requests during the quiet mode time, including telnet, SSH, SNMP, HTTP, or HTTPS. The device will restart accepting connection requests once the quiet mode period has ended. The start and conclusion of the quiet mode time will be indicated by a Syslog message. The number of failed attempts should be counted throughout a period of time that is measured from each failed attempt. Failed attempts are not counted during the quiet period. When the quiet period expires, the count of failed attempts resumes. A quiet period can be ended before the timer expires by disabling the functionality.

If authorization is enabled, both the identity and read/write privileges of the user are verified. If authorization isn\u2019t enabled, only the identity of the user is verified. The authorization/authentication method used is determined by the order that the authentication methods are selected. If the first authentication method isn\u2019t available, the next selected method is used. For example, if the selected authentication methods are RADIUS and Local, and all configured RADIUS servers are queried in priority order and don\u2019t reply, the user is authorized/authenticated locally. If authorization is enabled, and an authentication method fails or the user has insufficient privilege level, the user is denied access to the device. In other words, if authentication fails for an authentication method, the device stops the authentication attempt; it doesn\u2019t continue and doesn\u2019t attempt to use the next authentication method. Similarly, if authorization isn\u2019t enabled, and authentication fails for a method, the device stops the authentication attempt.

Network security can be increased by limiting access on a port to users with specific MAC addresses. The MAC addresses can be either dynamically learned or statically configured. Port security monitors received and learned packets. Access to locked ports is limited to users with specific MAC addresses. Port Security has four modes: Classic Lock\u2014All learned MAC addresses on the port are locked, and the port doesn\u2019t learn any new MAC addresses. The learned addresses aren\u2019t subject to aging or relearning. Limited Dynamic Lock\u2014The device learns MAC addresses up to the configured limit of allowed addresses. After the limit is reached, the device doesn\u2019t learn additional addresses. In this mode, the addresses are subject to aging and relearning. Secure Permanent\u2014Keeps the current dynamic MAC addresses associated with the port (as long as the configuration was saved to the Start configuration file). New MAC addresses can be learned as Permanent Secure ones up to the maximum addresses allowed on the port. Relearning and aging are disabled. Secure Delete on Reset\u2014Deletes the current dynamic MAC addresses associated with the port after reset. New MAC addresses can be learned as Delete-On-Reset ones up to the maximum addresses allowed on the port. Relearning and aging are disabled. When a frame from a new MAC address is detected on a port where it\u2019s not authorized (the port is classically locked, and there\u2019s a new MAC address, or the port is dynamically locked, and the maximum number of allowed addresses has been exceeded), the protection mechanism is invoked, and one of the following actions can take place: Frame is discarded. Frame is forwarded. Port is shut down. When the secure MAC address is seen on another port, the frame is forwarded, but the MAC address isn\u2019t learned on that port. In addition to one of these actions, you can also generate traps, and limit their frequency and number to avoid overloading the devices. To configure port security, complete the following: Procedure Step 1 Click Security > Port Security. Step 2 Select an interface to be modified, and click Edit. Step 3 Enter the parameters. Interface\u2014Select the interface name. Interface Status\u2014Select to lock the port. Learning Mode\u2014Select the type of port locking. To configure this field, the Interface Status must be unlocked. The Learning Mode field is enabled only if the Interface Status field is locked. To change the Learning Mode, the Lock Interface must be cleared. After the mode is changed, the Lock Interface can be reinstated. The options are: Classic Lock\u2014Locks the port immediately, regardless of the number of addresses that have already been learned. Limited Dynamic Lock\u2014Locks the port by deleting the current dynamic MAC addresses associated with the port. The port learns up to the maximum addresses allowed on the port. Both relearning and aging of MAC addresses are enabled. Secure Permanent\u2014Keeps the current dynamic MAC addresses associated with the port and learns up to the maximum number of addresses allowed on the port (set by Max No. of Addresses Allowed). Relearning and aging are disabled. Secure Delete on Reset\u2014Deletes the current dynamic MAC addresses associated with the port after reset. New MAC addresses can be learned as Delete-On-Reset ones up to the maximum addresses allowed on the port. Relearning and aging are disabled. Max No. of Addresses Allowed\u2014Enter the maximum number of MAC addresses that can be learned on the port if Limited Dynamic Lock learning mode is selected. The number 0 indicates that only static addresses are supported on the interface. Action on Violation\u2014Select an action to be applied to packets arriving on a locked port. The options are: Discard\u2014Discards packets from any unlearned source Forward\u2014Forwards packets from an unknown source without learning the MAC address Shutdown\u2014Discards packets from any unlearned source, and shuts down the port The port remains shut down until reactivated, or until the device is rebooted. Trap\u2014Select to enable traps when a packet is received on a locked port. This is relevant for lock violations. For Classic Lock, this is any new address received. For Limited Dynamic Lock, this is any new address that exceeds the number of allowed addresses. Trap Frequency\u2014Enter minimum time (in seconds) that elapses between traps. Step 4 Click Apply.

The Certificate Settings feature allows these applications and device managers to do the following: Install trusted CA certificates and to remove certificates that are no longer wanted Statically add certificates to device configuration file Manage a revocation list of untrusted certificates Note The validity of the certificates is based on the system clock. Use the default system clock or it does not provide proper validation. Therefore, make sure the system clock is based on device Real time clock (if supported) or was actively set since the last reboot (preferably via SNTP service). If the system clock is not based on RTC or was not set since last reboot validation of certificate will fail, even if the system clock is within the validity date of the certificate. Dynamic CertificatesThe CBD and PNP applications can install dynamic trusted certificates to the device memory. The installed certificate must include the following attributes: Certificate name - A string that is used to identify the certificate. Owner - The application name that installed the certificate (for example, PNP, CBD) The certificate itself in PEM format. An application can also delete a specific or all dynamic certificates installed by that application. Considerations Up to 512 dynamic certificates can be installed on the device. Dynamic certificates are removed when the device reboots Static Certificates If an application wants to add a certificate that will not be deleted on reset, or if a user of the switch wants to add a certificate, they can add a static certificate. These certificates are saved in the device running configuration and can be copied to the startup configuration. Adding a static certificate requires providing the following attributes: Certificate name - This is a string that is used to identify the certificate. Owner - the name of the application that installed the certificate (for example, PNP, CBD), or \"static\" if certificate is added by a user. The certificate itself in PEM format. Considerations Up to 256 static certificates can be installed on the device. It is possible for identical certificates to be added by different applications or users as long as the names used to identify them are different.",

There are two ways of determining how traffic in queues is handled, Strict Priority and Weighted Round Robin (WRR). Strict Priority\u2014Egress traffic from the highest-priority queue is transmitted first. Traffic from the lower queues is processed only after the highest queue has been transmitted, thus providing the highest level of priority of traffic to the highest numbered queue. Weighted Round Robin (WRR)\u2014In WRR mode the number of packets sent from the queue is proportional to the weight of the queue (the higher the weight the more frames are sent). For example, if there are a maximum of four queues possible and all four queues are WRR and the default weights are used, queue 1 receives 1/15 of the bandwidth (assuming all queues are saturated and there\u2019s congestion), queue 2 receives 2/15, queue 3 receives 4/15 and queue 4 receives 8 /15 of the bandwidth. The type of WRR algorithm used in the device isn\u2019t the standard Deficit WRR (DWRR), but rather Shaped Deficit WRR (SDWRR). The queuing modes can be selected in the Queue page. When the queuing mode is by strict priority, the priority sets the order in which queues are serviced, starting with the highest priority queue and going to the next lower queue when each queue is completed. When the queuing mode is Weighted Round Robin, queues are serviced until their quota has been used up and then another queue is serviced. It\u2019s also possible to assign some of the lower queues to WRR, while keeping some of the higher queues in strict priority. In this case traffic for the strict-priority queues is always sent before traffic from the WRR queues. Only after the strict-priority queues have been emptied is traffic from the WRR queues forwarded. (The relative portion from each WRR queue depends on its weight). To select the priority method and enter WRR data, complete the following steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Quality of Service > General > Queue. Step 2 Enter the parameters. Queue\u2014Displays the queue number. Scheduling Method\u2014Select one of the following options: Strict Priority\u2014Traffic scheduling for the selected queue and all higher queues is based strictly on the queue priority. WRR\u2014Traffic scheduling for the selected queue is based on WRR. The period time is divided between the WRR queues that aren\u2019t empty, meaning they have descriptors to egress. This division happens only if the strict-priority queues are empty. WRR Weight\u2014If WRR is selected, enter the WRR weight assigned to the queue. % of WRR Bandwidth\u2014Displays the amount of bandwidth assigned to the queue. These values represent the percent of the WRR weight. Step 3 Click Apply. The queues are configured, and the Running Configuration file is updated.",

Thus, each applying the QoS on the class map (flow) at ports that are otherwise independent of each other. A single policer is created in the Policy Table page. Aggregate Policer\u2014An aggregate policer applies the QoS to one or more class maps, and one or more flows. An aggregation policer can support class maps from different policies. An aggregate policer applies QoS to all its flows in aggregation regardless of policies and ports. An aggregate policer is created in the Aggregate Policer page. An aggregate policer is defined if the policer is to be shared with more than one class. Policers on a port can\u2019t be shared with other policers in another device. Each policer is defined with its own QoS specification with a combination of the following parameters: A maximum allowed rate, called a Committed Information Rate (CIR), measured in Kbps. An amount of traffic, measured in bytes, called a Committed Burst Size (CBS). This is traffic that is allowed to pass as a temporary burst even if it\u2019s above the defined maximum rate. An action to be applied to frames that are over the limits (called out-of-profile traffic), where such frames can be passed as is, dropped, or passed, but remapped to a new DSCP value that marks them as lower-priority frames for all subsequent handling within the device. Configures traffic policing on the basis of the specified rates and optional actions Enter the CIR and these optional values and actions Assigning a policer to a class map is done when a class map is added to a policy. If the policer is an aggregate policer, you must create it using the Aggregate Policer page. To define an aggregate policer, complete the following steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Quality of Service > QoS Advanced Mode > Aggregate Policer. This page displays the existing aggregate policers. Step 2 Click Add. Step 3 Enter the parameters. Aggregate Policer Name\u2014Enter the name of the Aggregate Policer. Ingress Committed Information Rate (CIR)\u2014Enter the maximum bandwidth allowed in bits per second. See the description of this in the Bandwidth. Ingress Committed Burst Size (CBS)\u2014Enter the maximum burst size (even if it goes beyond the CIR) in bytes. See the description of this in the Bandwidth. Exceed Action\u2014Select the action to be performed on incoming packets that exceed the CIR. Possible values are: Drop\u2014Packets exceeding the defined CIR value are dropped. Out of Profile DSCP\u2014The DSCP values of packets exceeding the defined CIR value are remapped to a value based on the Out Of Profile DSCP Remarking Table. Step 4 Click Apply.

This page contains the existing SNMP groups and their security levels. Step 2 Click Add. Step 3 Enter the parameters. Group Name\u2014Enter a new group name. Security Model\u2014Select the SNMP version attached to the group, SNMPv1, v2, or v3. Three types of views with various security levels can be defined. For each security level, select the views for Read, Write, and Notify by entering the following fields: Enable\u2014Select this field to enable the Security Level. Security Level\u2014Define the security level attached to the group. SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 support neither authentication nor privacy. If SNMPv3 is selected, choose one of the following: No Authentication and No Privacy\u2014Neither the Authentication nor the Privacy security levels are assigned to the group. Authentication and No Privacy\u2014Authenticates SNMP messages, and ensures that the SNMP message origin is authenticated but doesn\u2019t encrypt them. Authentication and Privacy\u2014Authenticates SNMP messages, and encrypts them. View\u2014Select to associate a view with either read, write, and/or notify access privileges of the group limits the scope of the MIB tree to which the group has read, write, and notify access. Read\u2014Management access is read-only for the selected view. Otherwise, a user or a community associated with this group is able to read all MIBs except those that control SNMP itself. Write\u2014Management access is written for the selected view. Otherwise, a user or a community associated with this group is able to write all MIBs except those that control SNMP itself. Notify\u2014Limits the available content of the traps to those included in the selected view. Otherwise, there\u2019s no restriction on the contents of the traps. This can only be selected for SNMPv3. Step 4 Click Apply. The SNMP group is saved to the Running Configuration file.",

    "page_content": "Switches can either function on their own, or they can be connected into a stack of switches. By default, a device is always stackable, but has no stack port. All ports on the switches are network ports by default. You can look at a switch without any stack port as the active unit in a stack of only itself. You can also look at a switch without any stack port as a standalone switch. To stack two or more devices, reconfigure the desired network ports as stack ports in the switches and connect the switches with the resulting stack ports in a ring or chain topology. The switches (units) in a stack are connected through stack ports. These switches are then collectively managed as a single logical switch. In some cases, stack ports can become members in Link Aggregation Groups (LAGs) increasing the bandwidth of the stack port. The stack is based on a model of a single active/standby and multiple members. A stack provides the following benefits: Network capacity can be expanded or contracted dynamically. By adding a unit, the administrator can dynamically increase the number of ports in the stack while maintaining a single point of management. Similarly, units can be removed to decrease network capacity. The stacked system supports redundancy in the following ways: The standby unit becomes the active of the stack if the original active fails. The stack system supports two types of topologies: chain and ring. In ring topology, if one of the stack ports fails, the stack continues to function in chain topology. A process known as Fast Stack Link Failover is supported on the ports in a ring stack to reduce the duration of data packet loss when one of the stack ports link fails. Until the stack recovers to the new chain topology, a stack unit loops back the packets that are supposed to be sent through its failed stacking port, and transmits the looped back packets through its remaining stacking port to the destinations. During Fast Stack Link failover, the active/standby units remain active and functioning. Types of Units in Stack A stack consists of a maximum of eight units. A unit in a stack is one of the following types: Active\u2014The active unit\u2019s ID must be either 1 or 2. The stack is managed through the active unit that manages itself, the stand by unit and the member units. Stand by\u2014If the active unit fails, the stand by unit assumes the active role(switchover). The stand by unit\u2019s ID must be either 1 or 2. Member\u2014These units are managed by the active unit. In order for a group of units to function as a stack, there must be an active-enabled unit. When the active-enabled unit fails, the stack continues to function as long as there is a stand by unit (the main unit that assumes the active role).If the stand by unit fails, in addition to the active unit, and the only functioning units are the member units. These also stop functioning after one minute. This means for example, that if after 1 minute, you plug in a cable to one of the member units that was running without an active, the link will not come up. Backward Compatibility of Number of Units in Stack The stackable switches support anywhere from four units to eight units. This varies based on the switch model. Upgrading from and earlier software release can be done without changing the configuration files. When a firmware version, which does not support the hybrid stack modes is loaded to the stack and the stack is rebooted, the stack reverts to Native Stack mode. When a device in Hybrid stack mode is loaded with a firmware version that does not support Hybrid stack mode, its system mode reverts to the default system mode. If a stack\u2019s unit IDs were manually-configured, those units whose ID is greater than 4 are switched to auto numbering.",

    "page_content": "The units in a stack can be connected in one of the following types of topologies: Chain Topology\u2014Each unit is connected to the neighboring unit, but there is no cable connection between the first and last unit. Ring Topology\u2014Each unit is connected to the neighboring unit. The last unit is connected to the first unit. The following shows a ring topology of an eight-unit stack: A ring topology is more reliable than a chain topology. The failure of one link in a ring does not affect the function of the stack, whereas the failure of one link in a chain connection might cause the stack to be split. Topology Discovery A stack is established by a process called topology discovery. This process is triggered by a change in the up/down status of a stack port. The following are examples of events that trigger this process: Changing the stack topology from a ring to a chain Merging two stacks into a single stack Splitting the stack Inserting other member units to the stack, for instance because the units previously disconnected from the stack due to a failure. This can happen in a chain topology if a unit in the middle of the stack fails. During topology discovery, each unit in a stack exchanges packets, which contain topology information. After the topology discovery process is completed, each unit contains the stack mapping information of all units in the stack. Unit ID Assignment After topology discovery is completed, each unit in a stack is assigned a unique unit ID. The unit ID is set in the System Mode and Stack Management page in one of the following ways: Automatically (Auto) \u2014The Unit ID is assigned by the topology discovery process. This is the default setting. Manually\u2014The unit ID is manually set to an integer from 1-8. Duplicate Unit IDs If you assign the same unit ID to two separate units, only one of them can join the stack with that unit ID. If auto numbering has been selected, the duplicate unit is assigned a new unit number. If auto numbering was not selected, the duplicate unit is shut down. The following shows a case where two units were manually assigned the same unit ID. Unit 1 does not join the stack and is shut down. It did not win the active selection process between the active-enabled units (1 or 2). Duplicate Unit Shut Down Active Selection Process The active unit is selected from the active-enabled units (1 or 2). The factors in selecting the active unit are taken into account in the following priority: Force Active\u2014If Force Active is activated on a unit, it is selected. System Up Time\u2014The active-enabled units exchange up-time, which is measured in segments of 10 minutes. The unit with the higher number of segments is selected. If both units have the same number of time segments,and the unit ID of one of the units was set manually while the other unit\u2019s unit ID was set automatically, the unit with the manually-defined unit ID is selected; otherwise the unit with the lowest unit ID is selected. If both units IDs are the same, the unit with the lowest MAC address is chosen. Note The up time of the stand by unit is retained when it is selected as active in the switch failover process. Unit ID\u2014If both units have the same number of time segments, the unit with the lowest unit ID is selected. MAC Address\u2014If both units IDs are the same, the unit with the lowest MAC address is chosen. Note For a stack to operate, it must have an active unit. An active unit is defined as the main unit that assumes the active role. The stack must contain a unit 1 and/or unit 2 after the active selection process. Otherwise, the stack and all its units are partially shut down, not as a complete power-off, but with traffic-passing capabilities halted",

    "page_content": "This section describes various events that can cause a change to the stack. A stack topology changes when one of the following occurs: One or more units are connecting and/or disconnecting to and from the stack. Any of its stack ports has a link up or down. The stack changes between ring and chain formation. When units are added or removed to and from a stack, it triggers topology changes, master election process, and/or unit ID assignment. Connecting a New Unit When a unit is inserted into the stack, a stack topology change is triggered. The unit ID is assigned (in case of auto numbering), and the unit is configured by the active unit. One of the following cases can occur when connecting a new unit to an existing stack: No duplicate unit IDs exist. Units with user-defined IDs retain their unit ID. Units with automatically-assigned IDs retain their unit ID. Factory default units receive unit IDs automatically, beginning from the lowest available ID. One or more duplicate unit IDs exist. Auto numbering resolves conflicts and assigns unit IDs. In case of manual numbering, only one unit retains its unit ID and the other(s) are shutdown. The number of units in the stack exceeds the maximum number of units allowed. The new units that joined the stack are shut down, and a SYSLOG message is generated and appears on the master unit The following shows an example of auto numbering when an active-enabled unit joins the stack. There are two units with unit ID = 1. The active selection process selects the best unit to be the active unit. The best unit is the unit with the higher uptime in segments of 10 minutes.

    "page_content": "If the active unit fails, then the standby unit will take over the primary role and continues to operate the stack normally. For the standby switch to be able to take the place of the active switch, both units remain on reserve at all times. When on reserve mode, the active switch and its standby switches are synchronized with a static configuration (contained in both the Startup and Running configuration files). The standby switch configuration file remains on the previous active switch. Dynamic process-state information, such as the STP state table, dynamically-learned MAC addresses, dynamically-learned Smartport types, MAC Multicast tables, LACP, and GVRP are not synchronized. When an active switch is being configured, it synchronizes with the standby unit immediately. Synchronization is performed as soon as a command is executed. This is transparent. When an active switch is being configured, it synchronizes the backup immediately. Synchronization is performed as soon as a command is executed. This is transparent. If a unit is inserted into a running stack, and is selected as a standby unit, the active switch synchronizes it so that it has an up-to date configuration, and then generates a SYNC COMPLETE SYSLOG message. This is a unique SYSLOG message that appears only when standby is converging with the active unit, and looks like this: %DSYNCH-I-SYNCH_SUCCEEDED: Synchronization with unit 2 is finished successfully. Active / Standby Switchover When a active switch fails on the stack, a switchover occurs. The standby unit becomes the active, and all of its processes and protocol stacks are initialized to take responsibility for the entire stack. As a result, there is temporarily no traffic forwarding in this unit, but member units remain active. Note When STP is used and the ports are in link up, the STP port\u2019s state is temporarily Blocking, and it cannot forward traffic or learn MAC addresses. This is to prevent spanning tree loops between active units. Member Unit Handling While the standby unit becomes the active switch, the member units remain active and continue to forward packets based on the configuration from the original active switch. This minimizes data traffic interruption in units. After the standby unit has completed the transition to the active state, it initializes the member units one at a time by performing the following operations: Clear and reset the configuration of the member unit to default (to prevent an incorrect configuration from the new active unit). As a result, there is no traffic forwarding on the member unit. Apply related user configurations to the member unit. Exchange dynamic information such as port STP state, dynamic MAC addresses, and link up/down status between the new active and member unit. Packet forwarding on the member unit resumes after the state of its ports are set to forwarding by the active switch according to STP. Note Packet flooding to unknown Unicast MAC addresses occurs until the MAC addresses are learned or relearned. Reconnecting the Original Active Unit after Failover After failover, if the original active switch is connected again, the active selection process is performed. If the original active switch (unit 1) is reselected to be the active unit, the current active switch (unit 2, which was the original backup unit) is rebooted and becomes the backup once again. Note During active unit failover, the uptime of the standby unit is retained. Software Auto Synchronization in a Stack All units in the stack must run the same software version (firmware and boot code). Each unit in a stack automatically downloads firmware and boot code from the active unit if the firmware and/or boot code that the unit and the active are running is different. The unit automatically reboots itself to run the new version.",

    "page_content": "All ports on the device are network (uplink) ports by default. To connect units, you must change the types of the ports to be used to connect the devices as stack ports. These ports are used to transfer data and protocol packets among the units Stack Port Link Aggregation When two neighboring units are connected, the stack ports connecting them are automatically assigned to a stack LAG. This feature enables increasing the stack bandwidth of the stack port beyond that of a single port. There can be up to two stack LAGs per unit. The stack LAG can be composed of between two and up to the maximum number of stack ports depending on the unit type. Stack Port States Stack ports can be in one of the following states: Down\u2014Port operational status is down or stack port operational status is up, but traffic cannot pass on the port. Active\u2014Stack port was added to a stack LAG whose stack port operational status is up and traffic can pass on the port and it is a member of a stack LAG. Standby\u2014Stack port operational status is up and bidirectional traffic can pass on the port, but the port cannot be added to a stack LAG, and the port does not transmit traffic. Possible reasons for a port being in standby are: Stack ports with different speeds are used to connect a single neighbor. Backwards Compatibility The following modes have been expanded in the current software version of the device. Care must be taken when using these features in previous software versions: Stack Port LAG\u2014If a unit whose software supports stack ports in LAGs is connected to a unit whose software does not support stack ports in LAGs, the stack port connecting the units is not made a member of the stack LAG. The units are connected through the stack ports, and the active stack unit copies its software to the other unit. The software copied depends on the unit which becomes the active unit. Queues Mode\u2014This mode can be changed from 4 QoS queues to 8 QoS queues. There is no issue when upgrading from previous software versions that did not support 8 queues, since the 4-queue mode is the default queues mode in the current software version. However, when changing the queues mode to 8 queues, the configuration must be examined and adjusted to meet the desired QoS objectives with the new queues mode. Changing the queues mode takes effect after rebooting the system. Queue-related configuration that conflicts with the new queues mode is rejected. Stacking Mode\u2014The Stacking mode has been expanded to include hybrid stacking modes. There is no problem in upgrading from previous software versions, since the device will boot with the existing stacking mode (Native Stacking mode). If you want to downgrade software from a device that was configured in a hybrid stacking mode to a software version that does not support hybrid stacking, configure the device to Native Stacking mode first. Physical Constraints for Stack LAGs A stack LAG must contain ports of the same speed. When attempting to connect a unit to a stack whose topology is not a ring/chain (for example, trying to connect a unit to more than two neighboring units - star topology), only two stack LAGs can be active, the remainder of the stack ports are set to standby mode (inactive). Auto Selection of Port Speed The stacking cable type is discovered automatically when the cable is connected to the port (auto-discovery is the default setting). The system automatically identifies the stack cable type and selects the highest speed supported by the cable and the port. A SYSLOG message (informational level) is displayed when the cable type is not recognized.",

    "page_content": "Overview Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) is part of the IEEE specification (802.3az) that enables you to bundle several physical ports together to form a single logical channel (LAG). LAGs multiply the bandwidth, increase port flexibility, and provide link redundancy between two devices. Link aggregation allows you combine multiple Ethernet links to a single link between two network devices. The most common combinations involve connecting a switch to another switch, a server, a network attached storage (NAS) device, or a multiport WiFi access point. Network devices and management functions treat the link aggregation group (LAG) of multiple Ethernet connections as a single link. For example, you can include a LAG in a virtual local area network (VLAN). You can also configure more than one LAG on the same switch, or add more than two Ethernet links to the same LAG (the maximum number of links per LAG depends on your device). Some network devices support Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP), which helps to prevent errors in the link aggregation setup process. Link Aggregation Benefits Link Aggregation offers the following benefits: Increased reliability and availability- If one of the physical links in the LAG goes down, traffic reassigned to another physical links. Better use of physical resources- Traffic can be load-balanced across the physical links. Increased bandwidth- The aggregated physical links deliver higher bandwidth than each individual link. Cost effectiveness- A physical network upgrade can be expensive, especially if it requires new cable runs. Link aggregation increases bandwidth without requiring new equipment.",

Procedure Step 1 Make sure that both devices support link aggregation. Step 2 Configure the LAG on each of the two devices. Step 3 Make sure that the LAG that you create on each device has the same settings for port speed, duplex mode, flow control, and MTU size. Step 4 Make sure that all ports that are members of a LAG have the same virtual local area network (VLAN) memberships. If you want to add a LAG to a VLAN, set up the LAG first and then add the LAG to the VLAN; do not add individual ports. Warning Do not connect the devices to each other using more than one Ethernet cable until after you set up the LAG on each device. If you form multiple connections between the two devices and neither device has loop prevention, you create a network loop. Network loops can slow or stop normal traffic on your network. Step 5 Note the ports on each device to which you add the LAG, and make sure that you connect to the correct ones. The LAG issues an alert and rejects the configuration if the port members have different settings for port speed, duplex mode, or MTU size, or if you accidentally connect ports that are not members of the LAG. Step 6 Use Ethernet or fiber cable to connect the ports that you added to the LAG on each device. Step 7 Verify that the port LED for each connected port on each switch is blinking green. Step 8 Verify in the admin interface for each device that the link is up.",

    "page_content": "Overview Unidirectional Link Detection (UDLD) is a Layer 2-protocol that enables devices connected through fiber-optic or twisted-pair Ethernet cables to detect unidirectional links. A unidirectional link occurs whenever traffic from a neighboring device is received by the local device, but traffic from the local device is not received by the neighbor. The purpose of UDLD is to detect ports on which the neighbor does not receive traffic from the local device (unidirectional link) and to shut down those ports. All connected devices must support UDLD for the protocol to successfully detect unidirectional links. If only the local device supports UDLD, it is not possible for the device to detect the status of the link. In this case, the status of the link is set to undetermined. The user can configure whether ports in the undetermined state are shut down or merely trigger notifications. How UDLD Works When UDLD is enabled on a port, the following actions are performed: UDLD initiates the detection state on the port. In this state, UDLD periodically sends messages on every active interface to all neighbors. These messages contain the device ID of all known neighbors. It sends these messages according to a user-defined message time. UDLD receives UDLD messages from neighboring devices. It caches these messages until the expiration time (3 times message time) has passed. If a new message is received before the expiration time, the information in that message replaces the previous one. When the expiration time expires, the device does the following with the information received: If the neighbor message contains the local device ID\u2014The link status of the port is set to bidirectional. If the neighbor message does not contain the local device ID\u2014The link status of the port is set to unidirectional, and the port is shut down. If UDLD messages are not received from a neighboring device during the expiration time frame, the link status of the port is sent to undetermined and the following occurs: Device is in normal UDLD mode: A notification is issued. Device is in aggressive UDLD mode. The port is shut down. While the interface is in the bidirectional or the undetermined state, the device periodically sends a message each message time seconds. The above steps are performed over and over. Usage Guidelines Cisco does not recommend enabling UDLD on ports that are connected to devices on which UDLD is not supported or disabled. Sending UDLD packets on a port connected to a device that does not support UDLD causes more traffic on the port without providing benefits. In addition, consider the following when configuring UDLD: Set the message time according to how urgent it is to shut down ports with a unidirectional link. The lower the message time, the more UDLD packets are sent and analyzed, but the sooner the port is shut down if the link is unidirectional. If you want UDLD to be enabled on a copper port, you must enable it per port. When you globally enable UDLD, it is only enabled on fiber ports. Set the UDLD mode to normal when you do not want to shut down ports unless it is known for sure that the link is unidirectional. Set the UDLD mode to aggressive when you want both unidirectional and bidirectional link loss.",

If all packets headed for that port into the VLAN include a VLAN tag, that port is a tagged member of the VLAN. A port can only belong to one untagged VLAN, although it can belong to several tagged VLANs. In VLAN Access mode, a port can only belong to one VLAN. The port can be part of one or more VLANs if it is in General or Trunk mode. VLANs are used to solve security and scalability problems. VLAN traffic stays within the VLAN and is terminated at VLAN devices. It also simplifies network configuration by conceptually linking devices without requiring them to be physically relocated. A four-byte VLAN tag is applied to each Ethernet frame if it is VLAN-tagged. The tag comprises a VLAN ID ranging from 1 to 4094, as well as a VLAN Priority Tag (VPT) ranging from 0 to 7 When a frame enters a VLAN-aware device, the four-byte VLAN tag in the frame is used to classify it as belonging to a VLAN. The frame is classified to the VLAN based on the PVID (Port VLAN Identifier) defined at the ingress port where the frame is received if there is no VLAN tag in the frame or if the packet is merely priority-tagged. If Ingress Filtering is enabled and the ingress port is not a member of the VLAN to which the packet belongs, the frame is dropped at the ingress port. Only if the VID in the VLAN tag is 0 is a frame considered priority-tagged. Frames that belong to a VLAN stay in the VLAN. This is accomplished by transmitting or forwarding a frame only to members of the target VLAN's egress ports. A VLAN's egress port can be either tagged or untagged. The egress port's role is as follows: If the egress port is a tagged member of the target VLAN and the original frame does not include a VLAN tag, the egress port adds a VLAN tag to the frame. If the egress port is an untagged member of the target VLAN and the original frame has a VLAN tag, the VLAN tag is removed from the frame.",

    "page_content": "Layer 2 is where VLANs work. All VLAN traffic (Unicast, Broadcast, and Multicast) is contained within the VLAN. Over the Ethernet MAC layer, devices connected to separate VLANs do not have direct connectivity. Only Layer 3 routers allow devices from different VLANs to interact with one another. If each VLAN represents an IP subnet, an IP router is necessary to route IP traffic between them. The IP router could be a standard router with only one VLAN connected to each of its ports. VLAN untagged traffic to and from a standard IP router is required. Each of the IP router's interfaces can connect to one or more VLANs, making it a VLAN-aware IP router. Traffic to and from a VLAN-aware IP router can be VLAN tagged or untagged. Generic VLAN Registration Protocol is used by adjacent VLAN-aware devices to communicate VLAN information (GVRP). VLAN information is thus conveyed across a bridged network. Based on the GVRP information exchanged by devices, VLANs can be formed statically or dynamically on a device. A VLAN can be static or dynamic (thanks to the GVRP), but not both at the same time. Refer to the GVRP Settings section for further information about GVRP. QinQ QinQ provides isolation between service provider networks and customers' networks. The device is a provider bridge that supports port-based c-tagged service interface. With QinQ, the device adds an ID tag known as Service Tag (S-tag) to forward packets into the provider network. The S-tag is used to segregate traffic between various customers, while preserving the customer VLAN tags. Customer traffic is encapsulated with an S-tag with TPID 0x8100, regardless of whether it was originally c-tagged or untagged. The S-tag enables this traffic to be treated as an aggregate within a provider bridge network, where the bridging is based on the S-tag VID (S-VID) only. The S-Tag is preserved while traffic is forwarded through the network service provider's infrastructure, and is later removed by an egress device. An additional benefit of QinQ is that there is no need to configure customers' edge devices.",

    "page_content": "The Private VLAN feature provides layer-2 isolation between ports. This means that at the level of bridging traffic, as opposed to IP routing, ports that share the same Broadcast domain cannot communicate with each other. The ports in a private VLAN can be located anywhere in the layer 2 network, meaning that they do not have to be on the same switch. The private VLAN is designed to receive untagged or priority-tagged traffic and transmit untagged traffic. The following types of ports can be members in a private VLAN: Promiscuous\u2014A promiscuous port can communicate with all ports of the same private VLAN. These ports connect servers and routers. Community (host)\u2014Community ports can define a group of ports that are member in the same Layer 2 domain. They are isolated at Layer 2 from other communities and from isolated ports. These ports connect host ports. Isolated (host)\u2014An isolated port has complete Layer 2 isolation from the other isolated and community ports within the same private VLAN. These ports connect host ports. The following types of private VLANs exist: Primary VLAN\u2014The primary VLAN is used to enable Layer 2 connectivity from promiscuous ports to isolated and to community ports. There can only be a single primary VLAN per private VLAN. Isolated VLAN (also known as a Secondary VLAN)\u2014An isolated VLAN is used to enable isolated ports to send traffic to the primary VLAN. There can only be a single, isolated VLAN per private VLAN. Community VLAN (also known as a Secondary VLAN)\u2014To create a sub-group of ports (community) within a VLAN, the ports must be added a community VLAN. The community VLAN is used to enable Layer 2 connectivity from community ports to promiscuous ports and to community ports of the same community. There can be a single community VLAN for each community and multiple community VLANs can coexist in the system for the same private VLAN). Host traffic is sent on isolated and community VLANs, while server and router traffic is sent on the primary VLAN. Shared MAC address learning exists between all the VLANs that are members in the same private VLAN (although the switch supports independent VLAN learning). This enables Unicast traffic, despite the fact that host MAC addresses are learned by isolated and community VLANs, while routers and server MAC addresses are learned by the primary VLAN. A private VLAN-port can only be added to one private VLAN. Other port types, such as access or trunk ports, can be added to the individual VLANs that make up the private VLAN (since they are regular 802.1Q VLANs). A private VLAN can be configured to span across multiple switches by setting inter-switch ports as trunk ports and adding them to all VLANs in the private VLAN. Inter-switch trunk ports send and receive tagged traffic of the private VLAN\u2019s various VLANs (primary, isolated and the communities).",

The broadcast domains can associate with one another with the help of a Layer 3 device such as a router. A VLAN is mainly used to form groups among the hosts regardless of where the hosts are physically located. Thus, a VLAN improves security with the help of group formation among the hosts. When a VLAN is created, it has no effect until that VLAN is attached to at least one port either manually or dynamically. One of the most common reasons to set up a VLAN is to set up a separate VLAN for voice, and a separate VLAN for data. This directs the packets for both types of data despite using the same network. Create a VLAN Procedure Step 1 Log in to the web-based utility and choose VLAN Management > VLAN Settings. Step 2 Under the VLAN Table area, click Add to create a new VLAN. Step 3 VLAN can be added in two different methods as shown by the options below. Choose a radio button that corresponds to the desired method: VLAN \u2014 Use this method to create a specific VLAN. Range \u2014 Use this method to create a range VLANs. Step 4 If you chose VLAN in Step 3, enter the VLAN ID in the VLAN ID field. The range must be between 2 to 4094. Step 5 In the VLAN Name field, enter a name for the VLAN. For this example, the VLAN Name will be Accounting. Up to 32 characters may be used. Step 6 Check the VLAN Interface State check box to enable the VLAN interface state; it is already checked by default. If not, the VLAN will be effectively shut down, and nothing will be able to be transmitted or received through the VLAN. Step 7 Check the Link Status SNMP Traps check box if you want to enable the generation of SNMP traps. This is enabled by default. Step 8 If you chose Range in Step 3, enter the range of the VLANs in the VLAN Range field. The available range is 2\u20134094. For this example, the VLAN Range is from 3 to 52. Note Up to 100 VLANs can be created at a time. Step 9 Click Apply.",

GVRP will run only on 802.1Q trunk ports and is used primarily to prune traffic from VLANs that does not need to be passed between trunking switches. Use the following steps to configure GVRP. To ensure that port remains in General mode it is strongly advised to disable smartport macro auto on each interface participating in GVRP. Procedure Step 1 Configure the switch with the desired VLANs. For example, you can configure the following settings: Switch 1 can be assigned a VLAN ID of 1 as the default, then 300, 400 and 500. Switch 2 can be assigned a VLAN ID of 1 as the default. Switch 3 can be assigned a VLAN ID of 1 as the default, then 100 and 200. Step 2 To enable GVRP on an interface, it must be configured in General Mode, otherwise the switch will not send any GARP messages. Step 3 Enable GVRP globally. By default GVRP is not enabled for the switch. You must first enable GVRP on the switch before you can configure the 802.1Q ports for GVRP operation. Step 4 Configure the port for 802.1Q operation. GVRP will run only on ports that are configured for 802.1Q trunking. Step 5 Configure the port GVRP. GVRP must be configured on both sides of the trunk to work correctly. Step 6 (Optional) Configure the port registration mode. By default GVRP ports are in normal registration mode. These ports use GVRP join messages from neighboring switches to prune the VLANs running across the 802.1Q trunk link. If the device on the other side is not capable of sending GVRP messages, or if you do not want to allow the switch to prune any of the VLANs, use the fixed mode. Fixed mode ports will forward for all VLANs that exist in the switch database. Ports in forbidden mode forward only for VLAN 1.",

Check the following: What devices are connected to the switch? Analyze each device connected to the switch. Have you experienced any issues with those devices? Which ports are causing the problem and which devices are connected to those ports? Test the ports by connecting other devices and verifying if the problem continues. See if the device is causing issues on another port. Is it the port or the device? Determining whether it is the port, or the device determines how to continue the troubleshooting process.

    "page_content": "Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a Layer 2 link management protocol that provides path redundancy while preventing loops in the network. For a Layer 2 Ethernet network to function properly, only one active path can exist between any two stations. Multiple active paths among end stations cause loops in the network. If a loop exists in the network, end stations might receive duplicate messages. The STP uses a spanning-tree algorithm to select one switch of a redundantly connected network as the root of the spanning tree. The algorithm calculates the best loop-free path through a switched Layer 2 network by assigning a role to each port based on the role of the port in the active topology: Root\u2014A forwarding port elected for the spanning-tree topology Designated\u2014A forwarding port elected for every switched LAN segment Alternate\u2014A blocked port providing an alternate path to the root bridge in the spanning tree Backup\u2014A blocked port in a loopback configuration The switch that has all of its ports as the designated role or as the backup role is the root switch. The switch that has at least one of its ports in the designated role is called the designated switch. STP provides a tree topology for any arrangement of switches and interconnecting links, by creating a unique path between end stations on a network, and thereby eliminating loops. The device supports the following Spanning Tree Protocol versions: Classic STP- Provides a single path between any two end stations, avoiding and eliminating loops. Rapid STP (RSTP)- Detects network topologies to provide faster convergence of the spanning tree. This is most effective when the network topology is naturally tree-structured, and therefore faster convergence might be possible. RSTP is enabled by default. Multiple STP (MSTP)- MSTP is based on RSTP. It detects Layer 2 loops, and attempts to mitigate them by preventing the involved port from transmitting traffic. Since loops exist on a per-Layer 2-domain basis, a situation can occur when a port is blocked to eliminate a STP loop. Traffic will be forwarded to the port that is not blocked, and no traffic will be forwarded to the port that is blocked. This is not an efficient usage of bandwidth as the blocked port will always be unused. MSTP solves this problem by enabling several STP instances, so that it is possible to detect and mitigate loops separately in each instance. This enables a port to be blocked for one or more STP instances but non blocked for other STP instances. If different VLANs are associated with different STP instances, then their traffic will be relayed based on the STP port state of their associated MST instances. Better bandwidth utilization results. PVST+ /RPVST+ - (Rapid) Per VLAN Spanning Tree PVST+ is a protocol that runs a separate instance of the 802.1Q STP standard protocol per VLAN Rapid PVST+ is a protocol that runs a separate instance of the 802.1Q RSTP standard protocol per VLAN. As part of PVST/RPVST+ operation, a separate PVST frame is sent for each VLAN defined on a port. This enables maintaining state and topology per each VLAN SSTP- Cisco switches use special Shared Spanning Tree Protocol (SSTP) Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs) to exchange PVST+ and rapid PVST+ spanning tree topology information. They transmit SSTP BPDUs to the Cisco shared spanning tree MAC address 01-00-0C-CC-CC-CD. These BPDUs have a format based on a proprietary enhancement of IEEE standard 802.1Q. On the native VLAN, these BPDUs are untagged. When a port is configured in trunk mode with multiple VLANs, then it transmits the SSTP BPDUs on that port tagged for those VLANs. Interoperation Between Spanning Tree Protocols There are two main aspects to the interoperation of IEEE standard MSTP (including RSTP and STP) with PVST+ (and rapid PVST+). The first involves forming a common spanning tree between switches and regions running MSTP and PVST+. The second involves tunneling PVST+ spanning trees across MSTP regions. When a Cisco switch configured with PVST+ receives IEEE standard RSTP BPDUs on a port, it recognizes them, and sends two versions of BPDUs on the port: SSTP format BPDUs and IEEE standard STP BPDUs. Similarly, a switch configured with rapid PVST+ recognizes IEEE standard RSTP BPDUs, and on any port that receives RSTP BPDUs, it sends two versions of BPDUs: SSTP format and IEEE standard RSTP format BPDUs. There are differences between the ways that MSTP and PVST+ map spanning tree instances to VLANs: we know that PVST+ creates a spanning tree instance for every VLAN, whereas MSTP maps one or more VLANs to each MST instance. At the point where a PVST+ region meets an MSTP region, the set of PVST+ instances does not generally match the set of MST instances. Therefore, the PVST+ region and the MSTP region need to communicate with each other on a single common spanning tree instance. Interoperation between an MSTP region and a PVST+ region via the Common Spanning Tree is achieved as follows. MST and PVST+ both offer loop-free layer two topologies but they each use a different approach: MST maps multiple VLANs to an instance, reducing the number of spanning-tree instances. PVST+ calculates an instance for each spanning-tree instance. PVST+ sends BPDUs for each instance/VLAN so you could let MST process each BPDU separately with the instance that is configured for the VLAN. When an MST region is connected to a PVST+ topology, MST simulates PVST+ with a PVST simulation mechanism. The MST region will send PVST+ BPDUs (one for each VLAN) on the interfaces that are connected to PVST+ switches. These BPDUs all carry the same information and advertise the same root bridge. The interfaces that connect to the PVST+ topology are called boundary interfaces/ports. Since PVST+ switches now receive BPDUs for each VLAN from MST carrying the same information, they will all make the same decisions when selecting a root bridge, root port, etc. It is easiest to configure your network so that the MST region is the root bridge in your network. If your PVST+ domain has the root bridge, then MST will use the same root port for all VLANs. If the root bridge is in your MST region, then you change the cost per VLAN on your PVST+ switches to use different root ports and use a bit of load balancing.",

    "page_content": "SPAN (Switch Port Analyzer), also known as port mirroring or port monitoring, selects network traffic for analysis by a network analyzer. A Cisco Switch Probe device or another Remote Monitoring (RMON) probe can be used as the network analyzer. Port mirroring is a network device feature that sends a copy of network packets seen on a single device port, multiple device ports, or an entire Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) to a network monitoring connection on another device port. This is commonly used for network appliances that require network traffic monitoring, such as intrusion detection systems. The data packets are processed by a network analyzer connected to the monitoring port for diagnosis, debugging, and performance monitoring. The Remote Switch Port Analyzer (RSPAN) is a SPAN extension. RSPAN extends SPAN by allowing you to monitor multiple switches across your network and define the analyzer port on a remote switch. This means you'll be able to centralize your network capture devices. RSPAN works by mirroring traffic from an RSPAN session's source ports onto a VLAN dedicated to the RSPAN session. This VLAN is then trunked to other switches, allowing RSPAN session traffic to traverse multiple switches. Traffic from the RSPAN session VLAN is simply mirrored out the destination port on the switch that contains the session's destination port. The traffic for each RSPAN session is carried over a user-specified RSPAN VLAN that is dedicated for that RSPAN session in all participating switches. The traffic from the source interfaces on the start device is copied to the RSPAN VLAN through a reflector port. This is a physical port that has to be set. It is used exclusively to build an RSPAN session. The \"network\" keyword is required when specifying the reflector port, and non-RSPAN traffic is allowed over the link. The reflector port has these characteristics: It can be a physical port that is assigned to an EtherChannel group, even if the EtherChannel group is specified as a SPAN source. The port is removed from the group while it is configured as a reflector port. A port used as a reflector port cannot be a SPAN source or destination port, nor can a port be a reflector port for more than one session at a time. It is invisible to all VLANs. Spanning tree is automatically disabled on a reflector port. A reflector port receives copies of sent and received traffic for all monitored source ports. RSPAN Traffic Flow Each RSPAN session's traffic is routed over a user-specified RSPAN VLAN that is dedicated to that RSPAN session in all participating switches. The traffic from the start device's source interfaces is copied to the RSPAN VLAN via a reflector port. This is a physical port that must be configured and requires a \"network\" keyword that allows other traffic over the link. This reflector port serves as a mechanism for copying packets to an RSPAN VLAN. RSPAN traffic is then routed through trunk ports on intermediate devices to the final switch's destination session. The RSPAN VLAN is monitored by the destination switch and copied to a destination port. RSPAN Port Membership Rules On all switches \u2014 Membership in RSPAN VLAN can be tagged only. Start Switch SPAN source interfaces are not permitted to be members of the RSPAN VLAN. Reflector port cannot be a member of this VLAN. Intermediate Switch It is recommended that RSPAN membership be removed from all ports that are not used to pass mirrored traffic. An RSPAN VLAN typically has two ports. Final Switch Mirrored traffic requires that the source ports be members of the RSPAN VLAN. RSPAN membership should be removed from all other ports, including the destination interface.",

    "page_content": "Multicast offers an efficient communication mechanism for sending messages to multiple recipients in separate locations. It is also capable of supporting many-to-many and many-to-one communication. Multicast applications use User Datagram Protocol (UDP) on IP. Messages are sent by a source (called the sender) and will send messages (termed as a stream) even if there is not another device on the network interested in receiving that information. Receivers, on the other hand, must subscribe to a particular multicast stream in order to inform the network to forward those messages. IP multicasting is an efficient way to use network resources, especially for bandwidth-intensive services such as audio and video. IP multicast routing enables a host (source) to send packets to a group of hosts (receivers) anywhere within the IP network by using a special form of IP address called the IP multicast group address. The sending host inserts the multicast group address into the IP destination address field of the packet, and IP multicast routers and multilayer switches forward incoming IP multicast packets out all interfaces that lead to members of the multicast group. Any host, regardless of whether it is a member of a group, can send to a group. However, only the members of a group receive the message Default IP Multicast Routing Configuration This table displays the default IP multicast routing configuration. Table 1.

    "page_content": "Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) is a protocol designed for multicast purposes. With IGMP, you can establish group memberships between different users within a network. IGMP is mainly used for multimedia streaming, such as video-chat, between different users in a network. Snooping is the term used when a third party in a communication listens or observes the current connection data traffic. Therefore, IGMP Snooping is a process that listens specifically to multicast traffic. You can enable IGMP Snooping to forward multicast traffic to only already registered multicast clients on specific ports of the switch. This way, the multicast frames are only forwarded to a specific multicast client within a VLAN instead of to all the users in that VLAN. Multicast is the network layer technique used to transmit data packets from one host to selected hosts in the network. At the lower layer, the switch broadcasts the multicast traffic on all ports, even if only one host needs to receive it. Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) snooping is used to forward Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) multicast traffic to the desired host. On the other hand, Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) snooping is used to forward Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) multicast traffic to the desired hosts. When IGMP is enabled, it detects the IGMP messages exchanged between the IPv4 router and the multicast hosts attached to the interfaces. It then maintains a table that restricts IPv4 multicast traffic and forwards them dynamically to the parts that need to receive them. The following configurations are prerequisites for configuring IGMP. Configure Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN). Enable Bridge Multicast Filtering. When MLD is enabled, it detects the MLD messages exchanged between the IPv6 router and the multicast hosts attached to the interfaces. It then maintains a table that restricts IPv6 multicast traffic and forwards them dynamically to the ports that need to receive them.",

    "page_content": "IGMP/MLD Proxy is a simple IP Multicast protocol. Using IGMP/MLD Proxy to replicate Multicast traffic on devices like edge boxes can make the design and installation of these devices a lot easier. It decreases not just the cost of the devices, but also the operational overhead, by not supporting more advanced Multicast routing protocols like Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) or Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP). Another benefit is that it makes proxy devices independent of the core network routers' Multicast routing protocol. As a result, proxy devices are simple to set up in any Multicast network. IGMP/MLD Proxy Tree The IGMP/MLD Proxy operates in a simple tree topology in which a robust Multicast routing protocol is not required (for example, PIM). It is sufficient to utilize a simple IPM Routing system based on learning group membership and proxy group membership information and forwarding Multicast packets based on that information. Each proxy device must be manually setup by identifying upstream and downstream interfaces. In addition, the proxying tree topology's IP addressing scheme should be adjusted such that a proxy device can win the IGMP/MLD Querier election and forward Multicast traffic. Within the tree, there should be no other Multicast routers except the proxy devices, and the root of the tree should be connected to a larger multicast structure. A proxy device that uses IGMP/MLD forwarding has a single upstream interface and one or more downstream interfaces. These designations are explicitly configured; no protocol exists to determine the type of each interface. On its downstream interfaces, a proxy device performs the router portion of IGMP/MLD, and on its upstream interface, it performs the host portion of IGMP/MLD. Forwarding Rules and Querier The following rules are applied. A Multicast packet received on the upstream interface is forwarded on all downstream interfaces requesting the packet only if the proxy device is the querier on the interfaces. A proxy device drops Multicast packets received on a downstream interface if it is not the querier on the interface. A Multicast packet received on a downstream interface on which the proxy device is the querier is forwarded on the upstream interface and on all downstream interfaces requesting the packet only if the proxy device is the querier on the interfaces.",

    "page_content": "For IGMP to work, an IGMP querier is required. While a Multicast router is more appropriate in Multicast handling, the Cisco Small Business Switches can fulfill part of that role as long as the configuration is done properly. Because of IGMP snooping is linked to the VLAN to which multicast traffic is flowing, one can think of having a multicast sever located in one VLAN while the subscriber is located in a different VLAN. In this setup, 2 VLANs will be used. One VLAN where multicast traffic will take place, VLAN 115, and the second VLAN is the default; in our case, it is VLAN 1. Procedure Step 1 For the VLAN assignment, Switch B, the non-querier switch is uplinked to SW A, the querier through their ports 3. Both ports will be set as Trunk 1U, 115T (VLAN 1 untagged, VLAN 115 tagged). Port 1 of switch A will have the Multicast server connected to it, VLAN 115U, Access Port 2 of switch A will have the subscriber connected to it, VLAN 115U, Access Port 1 of switch B will have the subscriber connected to it, VLAN 115U, Access Port 2 of switch B will have the subscriber connected to it, VLAN 115U, Access Port 10 of Switch A will have the router connected to it, VLAN 1U, 115T, Trunk Step 2 The port on the router to which the switch is connected to should be a trunk port VLAN 1U, 115T. Make sure corresponding IP addresses, and DHPC settings are set as appropriate. Step 3 Go to the main configuration page for Multicast > IGMP Snooping on the switch. The location of this page will be different based on the switch model. Step 4 Check Enable for the following: IGMP Snooping Status IGMP Querier Status Step 5 Next, select VLAN 115 and click Edit. Step 6 Check Enable to enable IGMP Snooping Status. Step 7 Check MRouter Ports Auto Learn to enable. This option is for the switch to automatically learn where the querier (Multicast Router) is located. Therefore, do no check this option if the switch will be acting as the querier. Step 8 Check Immediate Leave to enable. This option can be enabled or disabled without fear of side effects to IGMP Snooping functionality. When enabled, it is meant to reduce the time it takes to block unnecessary IGMP traffic sent to a device port. Step 9 Leave the Last Member Query Counter to its default setting and close the window to proceed to the next step. Step 10 Go back to the main configuration page for Multicast > IGMP Snooping on the switch. The location of this page will be different based on the switch model. Step 11 Check IGMP Querier Status to enable. Only enable this option if this switch will be acting as a querier, otherwise, leave it alone. In our case, only one querier is being set. Step 12 Next, select VLAN 115 and click Edit. Step 13 Check IGMP Querier Status to enable the switch to act as a querier. Please do so only if this switch is intended to act as a querier. In most setup, only one querier is needed. Step 14 Check IGMP Querier Election. This option can be used to manage a situation where more than 1 querier in the VLAN is being used and that IGMP Querier Status is globally enabled on the second querier. Step 15 Select the IGM Querier version, (version 2 or version 3). Most of the time it will be version 2 since selecting version 3 is used when there are switches and /or routers in the VLAN that perform source-specific IP Multicast forwarding. Step 16 Select \u201cUser Defined\u201d for \u201cQuerier Source IP address\u201d and select the IP address of the switch that is acting as the querier. Step 17 Now that tweaks have been made on snooping page, we need to enable Bridge multicast Filtering to make the whole thing to work. Go to Multicast > Properties on the web UI of the switch. Step 18 Check Bridge Multicast Filtering Status to enable the switch to handle multicast in concert with IGMP snooping. If this feature is not checked, which is the default, multicast traffic is seen across all the ports. Step 19 Select VLAN 115 or any specific VLAN. Select the \u201cForwarding Method\u201d; here we selected \u201cIP Group Address\u201d so that Multicast IP address is seen in \u201cMulticast /IP Multicast Group Address\u201d table instead of MAC addresses in \u201cMulticast /MAC Group Address\u201d table if \u201cMAC Group Address\u201d was chosen instead. Step 20 By default, Multicast Router Port is set to None. No need to adjust anything here. On a non-querier switch, the uplink port to the querier device will be selected as Dynamic. To check on this, select VLAN 115, hit \u201cgo\u201d and note port 3 is selected on Dynamic row. This is to indicate that switch B is a non-querier but has detected a querier on its uplink port. Step 21 Click Multicast > Forward All and make sure that it is set to None. It is normally set to \"None\" by default. This also applies to the querier switch. Step 22 Click Multicast > Unregistered Multicast. The default setting is set to Forwarding all, meaning, all multicast traffic, registered or unregistered are forwarded. If you do not want unregistered traffic to be forwarded, then set it to \u201cFiltering\u201d which is recommended, and only keep the \u201cForwarding\u201d setting selected only on ports where the Multicast server machines are connected. Step 23 Test to see if it works. Using VLC as the video streaming program and the video subscriber client, connect the devices are shown in the diagram. From the VLC server, start streaming video and start the client to subscribe to those streams. The results: Using VLC as the video streaming program and the video subscriber client, connect the devices are shown in the diagram. From the VLC server, start streaming video and start the client to subscribe to those streams. The results: Verify that the Multicast IP address is properly populated on Multicast /IP Multicast Group Address in VLAN 115. This is an indication that the client has successfully subscribed to the Video Streams In a setup of more than one switch, verify that the switch that is not acting as the querier has successfully identified the querier. On a non-querier switch, the uplink port to the querier device will be selected as Dynamic. To check on this, select VLAN 115, hit go and note port 3 is selected on Dynamic row. This is to indicate that this SW B is a non-querier but has detected a querier on its uplink port. Step 24 By default, multicast traffic is set on all ports on the switch until Multicast Bridge Filtering is enabled. If multicast traffic is emanated from VLAN x while subscribers are on VLAN y, the above configuration will not work. The use of Multicast TV can be used to accommodate this special configuration.",

    "page_content": "In an 802.1x environment, the Open (Monitoring) Access feature assists in distinguishing genuine authentication failures from failures caused by misconfiguration and/or a lack of resources. Open Access assists system administrators in understanding the configuration issues of hosts connecting to the network, monitors bad situations, and allows these issues to be resolved. When Open Access is enabled on an interface, the switch treats all RADIUS server failures as successes and allows access to the network for stations connected to the interfaces regardless of authentication results. Open Access modifies the standard behavior of blocking traffic on an authentication-enabled port until authentication and authorization are completed successfully. Authentication's default behavior is still to block all traffic except Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN (EAPoL). Open Access, on the other hand, gives the administrator the option of allowing unrestricted access to all traffic even if authentication (802.1X-based, MAC-based, and/or WEB-based) is enabled. When RADIUS accounting is enabled, you can log authentication attempts and gain visibility of who and what is connecting to your network with an audit trail. Authenticator Overview Port Administrative Authentication States The port administrative state determines whether the client is granted access to the network. The following values are available: force-authorized-Port authentication is disabled and the port transmits all traffic in accordance with its static configuration without requiring any authentication. The switch sends the 802.1x EAP-packet with the EAP success message inside when it receives the 802.1x EAPOL-start message. This is the default state. force-unauthorized-Port authentication is disabled and the port transmits all traffic via the guest VLAN and unauthenticated VLANs. The switch sends 802.1x EAP packets with EAP failure messages inside when it receives 802.1x EAPOL-Start messages. auto-Enables 802.1 x authentications in accordance with the configured port host mode and authentication methods configured on the port. Port Host Modes Ports can be placed in the following port host modes. Single-Host Mode- A port is authorized if there is an authorized client. Only one host can be authorized on a port. When a port is unauthorized and the guest VLAN is enabled, untagged traffic is remapped to the guest VLAN. Tagged traffic is dropped unless it belongs to the guest VLAN or to an unauthenticated VLAN. If a guest VLAN is not enabled on the port, only tagged traffic belonging to the unauthenticated VLANs is bridged. When a port is authorized, untagged and tagged traffic from the authorized host is bridged based on the static VLAN membership port configuration. Traffic from other hosts is dropped. A user can specify that untagged traffic from the authorized host will be remapped to a VLAN that is assigned by a RADIUS server during the authentication process. Tagged traffic is dropped unless it belongs to the RADIUS-assigned VLAN or the unauthenticated VLANs. Multi-Host Mode- A port is authorized if there is if there is at least one authorized client. When a port is unauthorized and a guest VLAN is enabled, untagged traffic is remapped to the guest VLAN. Tagged traffic is dropped unless it belongs to the guest VLAN or to an unauthenticated VLAN. If guest VLAN is not enabled on a port, only tagged traffic belonging to unauthenticated VLANs is bridged. When a port is authorized, untagged and tagged traffic from all hosts connected to the port is bridged, based on the static VLAN membership port configuration. You can specify that untagged traffic from the authorized port will be remapped to a VLAN that is assigned by a RADIUS server during the authentication process. Tagged traffic is dropped unless it belongs to the RADIUS-assigned VLAN or to the unauthenticated VLANs. Multi-Sessions Mode-Unlike the single-host and multi-host modes, a port in the multi-session mode does not have an authentication status. This status is assigned to each client connected to the port. Tagged traffic belonging to an unauthenticated VLAN is always bridged regardless of whether the host is authorized or not. Tagged and untagged traffic from unauthorized hosts not belonging to an unauthenticated VLAN is remapped to the guest VLAN if it is defined and enabled on the VLAN, or is dropped if the guest VLAN is not enabled on the port. You can specify that untagged traffic from the authorized port will be remapped to a VLAN that is assigned by a RADIUS server during the authentication process. Tagged traffic is dropped unless it belongs to the RADIUS-assigned VLAN or to the unauthenticated VLANs.",

    "page_content": "If more than one authentication method is enabled on the switch, the following hierarchy of authentication methods is applied: 802.1x Authentication: Highest WEB-Based Authentication MAC-Based Authentication: Lowest Multiple methods can run at the same time. When one method finishes successfully, the client becomes authorized, the methods with lower priority are stopped and the methods with higher priority continue. When one of authentication methods running simultaneously fails, the other methods continue. When an authentication method finishes successfully for a client authenticated by an authentication method with a lower priority, the attributes of the new authentication method are applied. When the new method fails, the client is left authorized with the old method. 802.1x Based Authentication The 802.1x-based authenticator is responsible for relaying transparent EAP messages between 802.1x supplicants and authentication servers. The EAP messages exchanged between supplicants and the authenticator are encapsulated in 802.1x messages, and the EAP messages exchanged between the authenticator and authentication servers are encapsulated in RADIUS messages. MAC-Based Authentication MAC-based authentication is an alternative to 802.1X authentication that allows network access to devices that lack the 802.1X supplicant capability (such as printers and IP phones). MAC-based authentication grants or denies network access based on the MAC address of the connecting device. In this case, the switch supports EAP MD5 functionality with the username and password being the client's MAC address, as shown below. Web-Based Authentication End-users who request access to a network via a switch are authenticated using WEB-based authentication. It allows clients who are directly connected to the switch to be authenticated using a captive-portal mechanism before being granted network access. Web-based authentication is client-based authentication that is supported in both Layer 2 and Layer 3 in the multi-sessions mode. When this method of authentication is enabled for a port, each host must authenticate itself in order to access the network. So you can have both authenticated and unauthenticated hosts on an enabled port. When web-based authentication is enabled on a port, the switch drops all traffic from unauthorized clients, with the exception of ARP, DHCP, and DNS packets. The switch allows these packets to be forwarded so that even unauthorized clients can obtain an IP address and resolve host or domain names. Unauthorized clients' HTTP/HTTPS over IPv4 packets are routed to the switch's CPU. When an end-user requests network access, if Web-based authentication is enabled on the port, a login page appears before the requested page. The user must enter his username and password, which are validated by a RADIUS server via the EAP protocol. The user is notified if authentication is successful. The user's session has now been authenticated. While the session is in use, it remains open. The session is terminated if it is not used within a specified time interval. The system administrator configures this time interval, which is known as Quiet Time. When a session expires, the username and password are lost, and the guest must re-enter them to start a new one.",

    "page_content": "If this option is enabled on the Port Authentication page, the RADIUS server can assign a VLAN to an authorized client. This is known as RADIUS-Assigned VLAN or Dynamic VLAN Assignment (DVA). The term RADIUS Assigned VLAN is used throughout this guide. When a port is in multi-session mode and RADIUS-Assigned VLAN is enabled, the device adds the port as an untagged member of the VLAN that the RADIUS server assigns during the authentication process. Untagged packets are classified as belonging to the assigned VLAN if they originate from authenticated and authorized devices or ports. Note In multi-session mode, RADIUS VLAN assignment is only supported when the device is in Layer 2 system mode. For a device to be authenticated and authorized at a DVA-enabled port: The RADIUS server must authenticate the device and assign it a VLAN dynamically. In the Port Authentication page, you can set the RADIUS VLAN Assignment field to static. This allows the host to be bridged based on static configuration. DVA must be supported by a RADIUS server with the RADIUS attributes tunnel-type (64) = VLAN (13), tunnel-media-type (65) = 802 (6), and tunnel-privategroup-id = a VLAN ID. When the RADIUS-Assigned VLAN feature is enabled, the host modes behave as follows: Single-Host and Multi-Host Mode- Untagged traffic and tagged traffic belonging to the RADIUS-assigned VLAN are bridged via this VLAN. All other traffic not belonging to unauthenticated VLANs is discarded Full Multi-Sessions Mode-Untagged traffic and tagged traffic not belonging to the unauthenticated VLANs arriving from the client are assigned to the RADIUS-assigned VLAN using TCAM rules and are bridged via the VLAN. Multi-Sessions Mode in Layer 3 System Mode This mode does not support RADIUS-assigned VLAN. The following table describes guest VLAN and RADIUS\u2010VLAN assignment support depending on authentication method and port mode. Table 2.

Violation Mode In single-host mode you can configure the action to be taken when an unauthorized host on authorized port attempts to access the interface. This is done in the Host and Session Authentication page. The following options are available: restrict-When a station attempts to access the interface with a MAC address other than the supplicant MAC address, a trap is generated. The shortest time between traps is one second. These frames are forwarded, but their source addresses remain unknown. protect-Frames with source addresses other than the supplicant address should be discarded. shutdown-Reject frames with source addresses other than the supplicant address and close the port. The device can also be configured to send SNMP traps with a configurable minimum time between consecutive traps. Traps are disabled if seconds = 0. If no minimum time is specified, the restrict mode defaults to 1 second and the other modes to 0. Quiet Period Following a failed authentication exchange, the port (single-host or multi-host modes) or the client (multi-sessions mode) cannot attempt authentication during the Quiet period. The period is defined per port in single-host or multi-host mode, and it is defined per client in multi-sessions mode. The switch does not accept or initiate authentication requests during the quiet period. Only 802.1x-based and Web-based authentications are subject to the period. You can also specify the number of login attempts allowed before the quiet period begins. A value of 0 indicates that the number of login attempts is unlimited. The Port Authentication page allows you to configure the duration of the quiet period as well as the maximum number of login attempts.",

    "page_content": "DHCPv4 Snooping DHCP snooping is a security feature that prevents false DHCP response packets from being received and logs DHCP addresses. This is accomplished by classifying ports on the device as trusted or untrusted. A trustworthy port is one that is allowed to assign DHCP addresses and is connected to a DHCP server. The device allows DHCP messages received on trustworthy ports to pass through. A port that is not allowed to assign DHCP addresses is known as an untrusted port. Until you declare a port trusted, it is regarded untrusted by default. DHCPv4 Relay DHCP Relay relays DHCP packets to the DHCP server. DHCPv4 in Layer 2 and Layer 3 The device relays DHCP messages received from VLANs that have DHCP Relay enabled in Layer 2 system mode. The device can also transmit DHCP signals received from VLANs that do not have IP addresses in Layer 3 system mode. Option 82 is automatically inserted whenever DHCP Relay is enabled on a VLAN without an IP address. This insertion takes place on a single VLAN and has no effect on the global administrative state of Option 82. Transparent DHCP Relay For Transparent DHCP Relay where an external DHCP relay agent is being used,do the following: Enable DHCP Snooping. Enable Option 82 insertion. Disable DHCP Relay. For regular DHCP Relay: Enable DHCP Relay. No need to enable Option 82 insertion. Option 82 Option 82 (DHCP Relay Agent Information Option) sends port and agent information to a central DHCP server, identifying the physical location of an allocated IP address on the network. Option 82's main objective is to aid the DHCP server in determining the optimum IP subnet (network pool) from which to receive an IP address. On the device, the following Option 82 settings are available: DHCP Insertion- Add Option 82 information to packets that do not have foreign Option 82 information. DHCP Pass through- Forward or reject DHCP packets that contain Option 82 information from untrusted ports. On trusted ports, DHCP packets containing Option 82 information are always forwarded. The packet flow through the DHCP Relay, DHCP Snooping, and Option 82 modules is shown in the table below: There are a variety of scenarios that could occur: Both the DHCP client and the DHCP server are on the same VLAN. A typical bridge passes the DHCP messages between the DHCP client and the DHCP server in this scenario. Both the DHCP client and the DHCP server are on different VLANs. Only DHCP Relay can and does broadcast DHCP messages between the DHCP client and the DHCP server in this case. Regular routers send unicast DHCP packets, therefore if DHCP Relay is enabled on a VLAN without an IP address or if the device is not a router (Layer 2), an external router is required. DHCP Relay and only DHCP Relay relays DHCP messages to a DHCP server. Interactions Between DHCPv4 Snooping, DHCPv4 Relay and Option 82 The tables below describe how the device behaves when various combinations of DHCP Snooping, DHCP Relay, and Option 82 are used.

An ISATAP or a manual mechanism is used for tunneling (see IPv6 Tunnel).

    "page_content": "A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is an attempt by a hacker to make a device inaccessible to its users. DoS attacks overload the device with external communication requests, preventing it from responding to legitimate traffic. These attacks typically result in a device CPU overload. Secure Core Technology (SCT) The device employs SCT as one method of resisting DoS attacks. SCT on the device is enabled by default and cannot be disabled. In addition to end-user (TCP) traffic, the Cisco device handles management traffic, protocol traffic, and snooping traffic. SCT ensures that no matter how much total traffic is received, the device receives and processes management and protocol traffic. This is accomplished by limiting TCP traffic to the CPU. There are no interactions with other features. Types of DoS Attacks The following types of packets or other strategies might be involved in a Denial of Service attack TCP SYN Packets\u2014These packets frequently have an incorrect sender address. Each packet is treated as a connection request, causing the server to spawn a half-open connection by sending back a TCP/SYN-ACK packet (Acknowledgment) and waiting for a packet from the sender address (response to the ACK Packet). However, because the sender address is incorrect, the response is never received. These half-open connections saturate the device's available connections, preventing it from responding to legitimate requests. TCP SYN-FIN Packets\u2014To establish a new TCP connection, SYN packets are sent. TCP FIN packets are used to terminate a connection. A packet with both the SYN and the FIN flags set should never exist. As a result, these packets may indicate an attack on the device and should be blocked. Martian Addresses\u2014Martian addresses are illegal from the point of view of the IP protocol. ICMP Attack\u2014Sending malformed ICMP packets or a large number of ICMP packets to the victim, potentially causing a system crash. IP Fragmentation\u2014The device receives mangled IP fragments with overlapping, over-sized payloads. Because of a bug in their TCP/IP fragmentation re-assembly code, this can cause various operating systems to crash. Stacheldraht Distribution\u2014The attacker connects to handlers, which are compromised systems that issue commands to zombie agents, facilitating the DoS attack. The attacker compromises agents through the handlers. Using automated routines to exploit vulnerabilities in programs that accept remote connections and are running on the remote hosts under attack. Each handler has the ability to command up to a thousand agents. Invasor Trojan\u2014A trojan that allows the attacker to download a zombie agent (or the trojan may contain one). Attackers can also gain access to systems by employing automated tools that exploit flaws in programs that listen for connections from remote hosts. This scenario primarily concerns the device when it acts as a web server. Back OrifaceTrojan\u2014This is a trojan variant that uses Back Oriface software to install the trojan. Defense Against DoS Attacks The Denial of Service (DoS) Prevention feature assists the system administrator in resisting such attacks in the following ways: Enable TCP SYN protection. If this feature is enabled, reports are issued when a SYN packet attack is identified, and the attacked port can be temporarily shut-down. A SYN attack is identified if the number of SYN packets per second exceeds a user-configured threshold. Block SYN-FIN packets. Block packets that contain reserved Martian addresses. Prevent TCP connections from a specific interface and rate limit the packets. Configure the blocking of certain ICMP packets. Discard fragmented IP packets from a specific interface. page) Deny attacks from Stacheldraht Distribution, Invasor Trojan, and Back Orifice Trojan.",

IPv6 First Hop Security Pipe If IPv6 First Hop Security is enabled on a VLAN, the switch traps the following messages: Router Advertisement (RA) messages Router Solicitation (RS) messages Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages Neighbor Solicitation (NS) messages ICMPv6 Redirect messages Certification Path Advertisement (CPA) messages Certification Path Solicitation (CPS) messages DHCPv6 messages Trapped RA, CPA, and ICMPv6 Redirect messages are routed to the RA Guard feature. RA Guard validates these messages, discards illegal messages, and forwards legal messages to the ND Inspection feature. ND Inspection validates these messages and discards illegal messages, while legal messages are routed to the IPv6 Source Guard feature. Trapped DHCPv6 messages are routed to the DHCPv6 Guard feature. DHCPv6 Guard validates these messages, discards illegal messages, and forwards legal messages to the IPv6 Source Guard feature. Data messages that are being trapped are routed to the IPv6 Source Guard feature. Using the Neighbor Binding Table, IPv6 Source Guard validates received messages (trapped data messages, NDP messages from ND Inspection, and DHCPv6 messages from DHCPv6 Guard), drops illegal messages, and forwards legal messages. Neighbor Binding Integrity obtains neighbors from received messages (NDP and DHCPv6) and saves them in the Neighbor Binding table. Static entries can also be manually added. After learning the addresses, the NBI feature forwards the frames. The ND Inspection feature also receives trapped RS,CPS,NS, and NA messages. ND Inspection validates these messages, discards illegal ones, and forwards legal ones to the IPv6 Source Guard feature. IPv6 First Hop Security Perimeter IPv6 First Hop Security switches can form a perimeter separating untrusted area from trusted area. All switches inside the perimeter support IPv6 First Hop Security, and hosts and routers inside this perimeter are trusted devices. For example, in the figure below, Switch B and Switch C are inner links inside the protected area. The perimeter is specified by the device-role command in the Neighbor Binding policy configuration screen. Each IPv6 First Hop Security switch binds neighbors partitioned by the edge. Binding entries are distributed in this manner on IPv6 First Hop Security devices that form the perimeter. The IPv6 First Hop Security devices can then provide binding integrity to the inside of the perimeter without having to configure bindings for every address on each device.",

    "page_content": "Neighbor Binding (NB) Integrity establishes binding of neighbors. A separate, independent instance of NB Integrity runs on each VLAN on which the feature is enabled. Learning Advertised IPv6 Prefixes NB Integrity learns IPv6 prefixes advertised in RA messages and saves it in the Neighbor Prefix table. The prefixes are used for verification of assigned global IPv6 addresses. By default, this validation is disabled. When it is enabled, addresses are validated against the prefixes in the Neighbor Binding Settings page. Static prefixes used for the address validation can be added in the Neighbor Prefix Table page. Validation of Global IPv6 Addresses NB Integrity performs the following validations: If the target address in an NS or NA message is a global IPv6 address, it must belong to one of the prefixes defined in the RA Prefix table. A global IPv6 address provided by a DHCPv6 server must belong to one of the prefixes defined in the IPv6 Prefix List. If a message does not pass this verification, it is dropped and a rate limited SYSLOG message is sent. Neighbor Binding Table Overflow When there is no free space to create a new entry, no entry is created and a SYSLOG message is sent. Establishing Binding of Neighbors An IPv6 First Hop Security switch can discover and record binding information by using the following methods: NBI-NDP Method: Learning IPv6 addresses from the snooped Neighbor Discovery Protocol messages NBI-DHCP method: By learning IPv6 addresses from the snooped DHCPv6 messages NBI-Manual Method: By manual configuration An IPv6 address is bound to a link layer property of the host's network attachment. This property, called a \"binding anchor\" consists of the interface identifier (if Index) through which the host is connected to and the host\u2019s MAC address. IPv6 First Hop Security switch establishes binding only on perimeterical interfaces. Binding information is saved in the Neighbor Binding table NBI-NDP Method The NBI-NDP method used is based on the FCFS- SAVI method specified in RFC6620, with the following differences: Unlike FCFS-SAVI, which supports only binding for link local IPv6 addresses, NBI-NDP additionally supports binding global IPv6 addresses as well. NBI-NDP supports IPv6 address binding only for IPv6 addresses learned from NDP messages. Source address validation for data message is provided by IPv6 Source Address Guard. In NBI-NDP, proof of address ownership is based on the First-Come, First- Served principle. The first host that claims a given source address is the owner of that address until further notice. Since no host changes are acceptable, a way must be found to confirm address ownership without requiring a new protocol. For this reason, whenever an IPv6 address is first learned from an NDP message, the switch binds the address to the interface. Subsequent NDP messages containing this IPV6 address can be checked against the same binding anchor to confirm that the originator owns the source IP address. The exception to this rule occurs when an IPv6 host roams in the L2 domain or changes its MAC address. In this case, the host is still the owner of the IP address, but the associated binding anchor might have changed. To cope with this case, the defined NBI-NDP behavior implies verification of whether or not the host is still reachable by sending DAD-NS messages to the previous binding interface. If the host is no longer reachable at the previously-recorded binding anchor, NBI-NDP assumes that the new anchor is valid and changes the binding anchor. If the host is still reachable using the previously recorded binding anchor, the binding interface is not changed. To reduce the size of the Neighbor Binding table, NBI-NDP establishes binding only on perimeterical interfaces (see IPv6 First Hop Security Perimeter) and distributes binding information through internal interfaces using NS and NA messages. Before creating an NBI-NDP local binding, the device sends a DAD-NS message querying for the address involved. If a host replies to that message with an NA message, the device that sent the DAD-NS message infers that a binding for that address exists in another device and does not create a local binding for it. If no NA message is received as a reply to the DAD-NS message, the local device infers that no binding for that address exists in other devices and creates the local binding for that address. NBI-NDP supports a lifetime timer. A value of the timer is configurable in the Neighbor Binding Settings page. The timer is restarted each time that the bound IPv6 address is confirmed. If the timer expires, the device sends up to 2 DAD-NS messages with short intervals to validate the neighbor. NBI-DHCP Method The NBI-NDP method is based on the SAVI-DHCP method specified in the SAVI Solution for DHCP, draft-ietf-savi-dhcp-15, September 11, 2012. Like NBI-NDP, NBI-DHCP provides perimeterical binding for scalability. The following difference between the NBI-DHCP and NBI-FCFS method exists: NBIDHCP follows the state announced in DHCPv6 messages, thus there is no need to distribute the state by NS/NA messages. NB Integrity Policy In the same way that other IPv6 First Hop Security features function, NB Integrity behavior on an interface is specified by an NB Integrity policy attached to an interface. These policies are configured in the Neighbor Binding Settings page",

Passwords, encryption, access control, and user authentication are used to create a secure approach for managing sensitive data at the institution. The capability has been enhanced to safeguard configuration files, secure the configuration process, and facilitate SSD zero-touch auto configuration. SSD secures sensitive data on a device, such as passwords and keys, by allowing and disallowing access to sensitive data encrypted and in plain text based on user credentials and SSD rules, and by preventing tampering with configuration files holding sensitive data. Furthermore, SSD allows for the secure backup and sharing of configuration files containing sensitive information. Users can select the level of protection they want for their sensitive data, ranging from no protection with sensitive data in plaintext to minimal protection with encryption based on the default pass phrase to higher protection with encryption based on user-defined pass phrase. Only authenticated and authorized users are granted read privilege to sensitive data, and this is done in accordance with SSD regulations. Through the user authentication procedure, a device authenticates and authorizes management access to users. It is advised that the administrator protect the authentication process by using the local authentication database and/or secure the communication to the external authentication servers used in the user authentication process, regardless of whether SSD is utilized. In summary, SSD uses SSD rules, SSD attributes, and user authentication to safeguard sensitive data on a device. And the device's SSD rules, SSD characteristics, and user authentication configurations are all critical data that SSD protects. SSD Management SSD management consists of a set of setup parameters that dictate how sensitive data is handled and secured. The SSD configuration parameters are sensitive information that is safeguarded by SSD. All SSD configuration is done through the SSD pages, which are only accessible to those with the appropriate rights. SSD Rules The read privileges and default read mode assigned to a user session on a management channel are defined by SSD rules. The user and SSD management channel that an SSD rule belongs to give it a distinct identity. It's possible that distinct SSD rules exist for the same user but for different channels, and that different rules exist for the same channel but for different users. Read permissions specify how sensitive data can be viewed: solely in encrypted form, exclusively in plaintext form, both encrypted and plaintext forms, or no authorization to access sensitive data at all. The SSD regulations are classified as sensitive data and are therefore safeguarded. There are a total of 32 SSD rules that can be supported by a device. The SSD read permission of the SSD rule that best matches the user identity/credential and the type of management channel via which the user is/will access the sensitive data is granted to a user by a device. A set of default SSD rules is included with every device. SSD rules can be added, deleted, and changed at any time by an administrator. Default SSD Rules The device has the following factory default rules: Rule Key Rule Action User Channel Read Permission Default Read Mode Level 15 Secure XML SNMP Plaintext Only Plaintext Level 15 Secure Both Encrypted Level 15 Insecure Both Encrypted All Insecure XML SNMP Exclude Exclude All Secure Encrypted Only Encrypted All Insecure Encrypted Only Encrypted The default rules can be modified, but they cannot be deleted.

Secure Copy (SCP) is a method of transferring firmware, boot images, configuration files, language files, and log files from a central SCP server to a device in a secure manner. With respect to SSH, the SCP running on the device is an SSH client application and the SCP server is a SSH server application. The data transfer is secure when files are downloaded through TFTP or HTTP. When files are downloaded with SCP, the data is sent across a secure channel from the SCP server to the device.

QoS looks at many different variables that exist on an network in order to make decisions on how it is going to deal with the issue. Problems that QoS Deals With Delay- less than ideal routes to the destination networks, and delays such as these can make some applications such as VoIP, fail. Main reason to use QoS is real\u2013time applications (RTA) Dropped Packets- Buffers are full and packets do not get processed in time so they are dropped. In a contention link QoS would prioritize traffic, so less important traffic would be dropped. Errors- Packets get corrupted for many reasons, but since we use TCP we will keep re-transmitting until we receave an ACK and that causes retransmissions and delays. Jitter- Packets may take multiple paths to a destination and may not be the most optimal path. This variation causes delays, which is called jitter. Jitter should be below 30 ms. Packet loss shouldn't be more than 1% Out of Order Delivery- Due to packets using varying paths to reach a destination, applications at the receiving end may take longer than expected to re-order the packets and cause delays and drops. QoS will ensure that applications with a required level of predictability will receive the needed bandwidth QoS Mechanisms Classification- supported by a class-oriented QoS mechanism. Congestion Management- Used to prioritize the transmission of packets, with a queuing mechanism on each interface. Policing-Used to enforce a rate limit by dropping or marking down packets. Shaping- Used to enforce a rate limit by delaying packets, using buffers. To configure general QoS parameters, perform the following: Procedure Step 1 Enable QoS by using the QoS Properties page to select the trust mode. Then enable QoS on ports by using the Interface Settings page. Step 2 Assign each interface a default CoS or DSCP priority by using the QoS Properties page. Step 3 Assign the schedule method (Strict Priority or WRR) and bandwidth allocation for WRR to the egress queues by using the Queue page. Step 4 Designate an egress queue to each IP DSCP/TC value with the DSCP to Queue page. If the device is in DSCP trusted mode, incoming packets are put into the egress queues based on the their DSCP/TC value. Step 5 Designate an egress queue to each CoS/802.1p priority. If the device is in CoS/802.1 trusted mode, all incoming packets are put into the designated egress queues according to the CoS/802.1p priority in the packets. This is done by using the CoS/802.1p to Queue page. Step 6 Enter bandwidth and rate limits in the following pages: Set egress shaping per queue by using the Egress Shaping Per Queue page. Set ingress rate limit and egress shaping rate per port by using the Bandwidth page.",

All traffic of the same class receives the same treatment, which is the single QoS action of determining the egress queue on the egress port, based on the indicated QoS value in the incoming frame. This can be the VLAN Priority Tag (VPT) 802.1p value in Layer 2 and the Differentiated Service Code Point (DSCP) value for IPv4 or Traffic Class (TC) value for IPv6 in Layer 3. When operating in Basic Mode, the device trusts this external assigned QoS value. The external assigned QoS value of a packet determines its traffic class and QoS. Advanced Mode\u2014Per-flow Quality of Service (QoS). In advanced mode, a per flow QoS consists of a class map and/or a policer: A class map defines the kind of traffic in a flow, and contains one or more ACLs. Packets that match the ACLs belong to the flow. A policer applies the configured QoS to a flow. The QoS configuration of a flow may consist of egress queue, the DSCP or CoS/802.1p value, and actions on out of profile (excess) traffic. Disable Mode\u2014In this mode all traffic is mapped to a single best effort queue, so that no type of traffic is prioritized over another. Only a single mode can be active at a time. When the system is configured to work in QoS Advanced mode, settings for QoS Basic mode are not active and vice versa. When the mode is changed, the following occurs: When changing from QoS Advanced mode to any other mode, policy profile definitions and class maps are deleted. ACLs bonded directly to interfaces remain bonded. When changing from QoS Basic mode to Advanced mode, the QoS Trust mode configuration in Basic mode is not retained. When disabling QoS, the shaper and queue setting (WRR/SP bandwidth setting) are reset to default values. All other user configurations remain intact.",

    "page_content": "SNMP is an application-layer protocol that provides a message format for communication between managers and agents. The SNMP system consists of an SNMP manager, an SNMP agent, and a MIB. The SNMP manager can be part of a network management system (NMS) such as CiscoWorks. The agent and MIB reside on the switch. To configure SNMP on the switch, you define the relationship between the manager and the agent. SNMP usually is associated with managing routers, but it\u2019s important to understand that it can be used to manage many types of devices. The switch functions as SNMP agent and supports SNMPv1, v2, and v3. The SNMP agent contains MIB variables whose values the SNMP manager can request or change. A manager can get a value from an agent or store a value into the agent. The agent gathers data from the MIB, the repository for information about device parameters and network data. The agent can also respond to a manager\u2019s requests to get or set data. An agent can send unsolicited traps to the manager. Traps are messages alerting the SNMP manager to a condition on the network. Traps can mean improper user authentication, restarts, link status (up or down), MAC address tracking, closing of a TCP connection, loss of connection to a neighbor, or other significant events. SNMP Versions The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is responsible for defining the standard protocols that govern Internet traffic, including SNMP. The IETF publishes Requests for Comments (RFCs), which are specifications for many protocols that exist in the IP realm. Documents enter the standards track first as proposed standards, then move to draft status. When a final draft is eventually approved, the RFC is given standard status\u2014although there are fewer completely approved standards than you might think. Two other standards-track designations, historical and experimental , define (respectively) a document that has been replaced by a newer RFC and a document that is not yet ready to become a standard. The following list includes all the current SNMP versions and the IETF status of each. SNMP Version 1 (SNMPv1 ) is the initial version of the SNMP protocol. It\u2019s defined in RFC 1157 and is a historical IETF standard. SNMPv1\u2019s security is based on communities, which are nothing more than passwords: plain-text strings that allow any SNMP-based application that knows the strings to gain access to a device\u2019s management information. There are typically three communities in SNMPv1: read-only, read-write, and trap. It should be noted that while SNMPv1 is historical, it is still the primary SNMP implementation that many vendors support. SNMP version 2 (SNMPv2 ) is often referred to as community-string-based SNMPv2. SNMP version 3 (SNMPv3 ) is the latest version of SNMP. Its main contribution to network management is security. It adds support for strong authentication and private communication between managed entities. To control access to the system, a list of community entries is defined. Each community entry consists of a community string and its access privilege. The system responds only to SNMP messages specifying the community which has the correct permissions and correct operation. SNMP agents maintain a list of variables that are used to manage the device. These variables are defined in the Management Information Base (MIB). Table 4. SNMP Versions and Security Levels Version Level Authentication Encryption SNMPv1 noAuthNoPriv Community string No SNMPv2C noAuthNoPriv Community string No SNMPv3 noAuthNoPriv Username No SNMPv3 authNoPriv Message Digest 5 (MD5) or Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) No SNMPv3 authPriv(requires the cryptographic software image) MD5 or SHA Data Encryption Standard (DES) or Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Note Due to the security vulnerabilities of other versions, it is recommended to use SNMPv3. SNMP Agent Functions The SNMP agent responds to SNMP manager requests as follows: Get a MIB variable\u2014The SNMP agent begins this function in response to a request from the NMS. The agent retrieves the value of the requested MIB variable and responds to the NMS with that value. Set a MIB variable\u2014The SNMP agent begins this function in response to a message from the NMS. The SNMP agent changes the value of the MIB variable to the value requested by the NMS. The SNMP agent also sends unsolicited trap messages to notify an NMS that a significant event has occurred on the agent. Examples of trap conditions include, but are not limited to, when a port or module goes up or down, when spanning-tree topology changes occur, and when authentication failures occur. SNMP Community Strings SNMP community strings authenticate access to MIB objects and function as embedded passwords. In order for the NMS to access the switch, the community string definitions on the NMS must match at least one of the three community string definitions on the switch. A community string can have one of these attributes: Read-only (RO)\u2014Gives read access to authorized management stations to all objects in the MIB except the community strings, but does not allow write access Read-write (RW)\u2014Gives read and write access to authorized management stations to all objects in the MIB, but does not allow access to the community strings. When a cluster is created, the command switch manages the exchange of messages among member switches and the SNMP application. The Network Assistant software appends the member switch number ( @esN, where N is the switch number) to the first configured RW and RO community strings on the command switch and propagates them to the member switches. Supported MIBs Management Information Base (MIBs) are collections of definitions which define the properties of the managed object within the device to be managed. For a list of supported MIBs, visit the following URL and navigate to the download area listed as Cisco MIBS: http:/www.cisco.com/cisco/software/navigator.html",
