    "page_content": "Front Panel The ports, LEDs, and Reset button are located on the front panel of the switch, as well as the following components: There are 2 device types with different console interface: Console port with RJ-45 and mini USB connector if both are connected the Mini USB has precedence over the RJ-45 RJ-45 connector only type of console. The console interface connects a serial cable to a computer serial port so that it can be configured using a terminal emulation program or mini USB cable (depending on the connector). USB Port\u2014The USB port connects the switch to a USB device so that you can save and restore the configuration files, firmware images, and SYSLOG files through the connected USB device. The USB port supports the FAT32 file system. RJ-45 Ethernet Ports\u2014The RJ-45 Ethernet ports connect network devices, such as computers, printers, and access points, to the switch. SFP+ Port (if present)\u2014The small form-factor pluggable plus (SFP+) are connection points for modules so that the switch can link to other switches. These ports are also commonly referred to as mini 10GigaBit Interface Converter ports. The term SFP+ is used in this guide. The SFP+ ports (if present) are compatible with the following Cisco SFP 1G optical modules MGBSX1, MGBLX1, MGBLH1, MGBT1, as well as other brands. The SFP+ ports are compatible with the following Cisco SFP 1G optical modules MGBSX1, MGBLX1, MGBLH1, MGBT1, as well as other brands. The Cisco SFP+ Copper Cable modules that are supported in the Cisco switches are: SFP-H10GB-CU1M, SFP-H10GB-CU3M, and SFP-H10GB-CU5M. The LEDs of the corresponding RJ-45 port flash green to respond to the SFP interface traffic. Small form-factor pluggable (SFP) ports are connection points for modules, so the switch can link to other switches. Some SFP interfaces are shared with one other RJ-45 and SFP+ port, called a combo port. When the SFP is active, the adjacent RJ-45 port is disabled. Reset button is used to reset or reboot the switch. The table below displays the reset behavior on the switch. Note Stack Behavior The reset button disable setting is applied to all units in the stack, meaning that if configured, the reset button on all units in the stack are disabled, and if not configured the reset button on all units in the stack are enabled. This applies also to units that join an existing stack. LEDs and Reset Behavior LEDs and Reset Behavior The following are the global LEDs found on the devices: Table 1. System LEDs Color Meaning Off System is not powered on. Solid Green System is operating normally. Flashing Green When not connected to CBD, the flashing green LED can indicate specific information (e.g. stack unit ID indication, reset button push duration, etc.). Solid Blue The CBD agent on the device is connected to the Dashboard. Flashing Blue When connected to CBD, the flashing blue LED supports can indicate specific information (e.g. stack unit ID indication, reset button push duration, etc.). Solid Amber System is receiving power but is not functioning properly. Flashing Amber When detecting hardware or firmware failure, and / or configuration file error which includes: Fail DRAM Read/Write self-test Firmware Header CEC checking on Flash Fail diagnosis and cannot bring up to the normal operation Fan failure (on models without dedicated fan LED (The Amber blinking frequency should be higher than green blinking). Table 2. Ethernet Port LEDs Color Meaning Off No link or port was administratively shut down. Solid Green Link present Blinking Green Activity on the switch. Port is sending or receiving data. Solid Amber PoE port is supplying power for downlink ports. Blinking Amber Port in SW defined warning (error disable, STP block.\u2026) for both downlink and uplink ports. Port LED Status Status 1: PD connects, the PoE supplying Power, Amber LED showing it's ON. Status 2: PD boot and Link is established, Amber LED is off and the Green LED is ON/blinking confirming link and traffic. Status 3: Once any SW defined errors happen (eg. error disable), the Green LED is OFF and the Amber LED will be blinking. Status 4: When the switch is in Status 2, push the reset button for about 1second, then the Amber LED will be ON for 5 seconds to indicate the PoE status, and then later it will return to the traffic status (Green LED is ON). Reset Button Behavior The following describes the different scenarios when the reset button is pushed for a defined set of time. When the Reset button is pushed for less than 1 sec, the Ethernet port LED will light in solid Amber for 5 seconds, when the port is supplying power for the device. When the Reset button is pushed for 1 to 5 sec, the system LED continues to be solid Green. If the Reset button is released, the system will not reload, and no action is taken. When the Reset button is pushed for 6 to 10 sec, the system LED will slowly flash Green. If the Reset button is released, the system will reload without a factory default. When the Reset button is pushed for 11 to 15 sec, the system LED will light in solid Green. If the Reset button is released, the system does not reload, and no action is taken. When the Reset button is pushed for 16 to 20 sec, the system LED will rapidly flash Green. If the Reset button is released, the system will reload to factory default settings. When the Reset button is pushed for more than 20 sec, the system LED will light in solid Green. If the Reset button is released, the system does not reload, and no action is taken.",

    "page_content": "Configuring Switches The switch can be accessed and managed over your IP network using the web-based interface, or by using the switch\u2019s command-line interface through the console port. Using the console port requires advanced user skills and is only supported on certain models. The following table shows the default settings used when configuring your switch for the first time. Parameter Default Value Username cisco Password cisco LAN IP 192.168.1.254 Configuring Your Switch Using the Web-based Interface Configuring Your Switch Using the Console Port Configuring Your Switch Using the Web-based Interface To access the switch with a web-based interface, you must know the IP address that the switch is using. The switch uses the factory default IP address of 192.168.1.254, with a subnet of /24. When the switch is using the factory default IP address, the System LED flashes continuously. When the switch is using a DHCP server-assigned IP address or an administrator has configured a static IP address, the System LED is a steady green (DHCP is enabled by default). If you are managing the switch through a network connection and the switch IP address is changed, either by a DHCP server or manually, your access to the switch will be lost. You must enter the new IP address that the switch is using into your browser to use the web-based interface. If you are managing the switch through a console port connection, the link is retained. To configure the switch using the web-based interface: Procedure Step 1 Power on the computer and your switch. Step 2 Connect the computer to any network port. Step 3 Set up the IP configuration on your computer. If the switch is using the default static IP address of 192.168.1.254/24, you must choose an IP address for the computer in the range of 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.253 that is not already in use. If the IP addresses will be assigned by DHCP, make sure that your DHCP server is running and can be reached from the switch and the computer. You may need to disconnect and reconnect the devices for them to discover their new IP addresses from the DHCP server. Note Details on how to change the IP address on your computer depend upon the type of architecture and operating system that you are using. Use your computers local Help and Support functionality and search for \u201cIP Addressing.\u201d Step 4 Open a web browser window. Step 5 Enter the switch IP address in the address bar and press Enter. For example, http:/192.168.1.254. Step 6 When the login page appears, choose the language that you prefer to use in the web-based interface and enter the username and password. The default username is cisco. The default password is cisco. Usernames and passwords are both case sensitive. Step 7 Click Log In. Step 8 If this is the first time that you have logged on with the default username and password, the Change username and Password. Enter a new username and password and confirm. If this is the first time that you have logged on with the default username and password, the Change username and Password page opens Note Please refer to the password complexity rule section in Login Settings before creating a password. Step 9 Click Apply. Caution Make sure that any configuration changes made are saved before exiting from the web-based interface by clicking on the Save icon. Exiting before you save your configuration results in all changes being lost. The Getting Started page opens. You are now ready to configure the switch. Refer to the Administration Guide or see the help pages for further information. Configuring Your Switch Using the Console Port To configure the switch using the console port, which is only supported on certain models, proceed with the following steps: Procedure Step 1 Connect a computer to the switch console port using a Cisco console cable (purchased separately) or a cable with mini USB connector. Step 2 Start a console port utility such as Hyper Terminal on the computer. Step 3 Configure the utility with the following parameters: 115200 bits per second 8 data bits no parity 1 stop bit no flow control Step 4 Enter a username and password. The default username is cisco, and the default password is cisco. Usernames and passwords are both case sensitive. If this is the first time that you have logged on with the default username and password, the following message appears: Please change your username AND password from the default settings. Change of credentials is required for better protection of your network. Please note that new password must follow password complexity rules Step 5 Set a new administrator username and password. Caution Make sure that any configuration changes made are saved before exiting. You are now ready to configure the switch. See the CLI Guide for your switch. Note If you are not using DHCP on your network, set the IP address type on the switch to Static and change the static IP address and subnet mask to match your network topology. Failure to do so may result in multiple switches using the same factory default IP address of 192.168.1.254. Console access also provides additional interfaces for debug access which are not available via the web interface. These debug access interfaces are intended to be used by a Cisco Support Team personnel, in cases where it is required to debug device\u2019s behavior. These interfaces are password protected. The passwords are held by the Cisco support team. The device supports the following debug access interfaces: U-BOOT access during boot sequence Linux Kernel access during boot sequence Run time debug modes- allows Cisco support team to view device settings and apply protocol and layer 1 debug commands and settings. The run time debug mode is accessible over telnet and SSH terminals in addition to the console.",

    "page_content": "Configuring Your Switch Using the Web-based Interface To access the switch with a web-based interface, you must know the IP address that the switch is using. The switch uses the factory default IP address of 192.168.1.254, with a subnet of /24. When the switch is using the factory default IP address, the System LED flashes continuously. When the switch is using a DHCP server-assigned IP address or an administrator has configured a static IP address, the System LED is a steady green (DHCP is enabled by default). If you are managing the switch through a network connection and the switch IP address is changed, either by a DHCP server or manually, your access to the switch will be lost. You must enter the new IP address that the switch is using into your browser to use the web-based interface. If you are managing the switch through a console port connection, the link is retained. To configure the switch using the web-based interface: Procedure Step 1 Power on the computer and your switch. Step 2 Connect the computer to any network port. Step 3 Set up the IP configuration on your computer. If the switch is using the default static IP address of 192.168.1.254/24, you must choose an IP address for the computer in the range of 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.253 that is not already in use. If the IP addresses will be assigned by DHCP, make sure that your DHCP server is running and can be reached from the switch and the computer. You may need to disconnect and reconnect the devices for them to discover their new IP addresses from the DHCP server. Note Details on how to change the IP address on your computer depend upon the type of architecture and operating system that you are using. Use your computers local Help and Support functionality and search for \u201cIP Addressing.\u201d Step 4 Open a web browser window. Step 5 Enter the switch IP address in the address bar and press Enter. For example, http:/192.168.1.254. Step 6 When the login page appears, choose the language that you prefer to use in the web-based interface and enter the username and password. The default username is cisco. The default password is cisco. Usernames and passwords are both case sensitive. Step 7 Click Log In. Step 8 If this is the first time that you have logged on with the default username and password, the Change username and Password. Enter a new username and password and confirm. If this is the first time that you have logged on with the default username and password, the Change username and Password page opens Note Please refer to the password complexity rule section in Login Settings before creating a password. Step 9 Click Apply. Caution Make sure that any configuration changes made are saved before exiting from the web-based interface by clicking on the Save icon. Exiting before you save your configuration results in all changes being lost. The Getting Started page opens. You are now ready to configure the switch.

To add or modify an existing ACL, complete the following steps: Procedure Step 1 In Configuration Wizards > ACL Configuration Wizard, click Launch Wizard. Step 2 Click Next. Step 3 In the ACL Configuration tab, select the ACL that you would like to configure from the drop-down menu. Then, enter the following fields: ACL Name\u2014Enter the name of a new ACL. ACL Type\u2014Select the type of ACL: IPv4 or MAC. Step 4 Click Next. Step 5 For the ACE Configuration, configure the following fields: Action on match\u2014Select one of the options: Permit Traffic\u2014Forward packets that meet the ACL criteria. Deny Traffic\u2014Drop packets that meet the ACL criteria. Shutdown Interface\u2014Drop packets that meet the ACL criteria, and disable the port from where the packets received. Step 6 For a MAC-based ACL, enter the fields: Source MAC Address Select Any if all source address are acceptable or User defined to enter a source address or range of source addresses. Source MAC Value Enter the MAC address to which the source MAC address is to be matched and its mask (if relevant). Source MAC Wildcard Mask Enter the mask to define a range of MAC addresses. Destination MAC Address Select Any if all destination addresses are acceptable or User defined to enter a destination address or a range of destination addresses. Destination MAC Value Enter the MAC address to which the destination MAC address is to be matched and its mask (if relevant). Destination MAC Wildcard Mask Enter the mask to define a range of MAC addresses. Note that this mask is different than in other uses, such as subnet mask. Here, setting a bit as 1 indicates don't care and 0 indicates to mask that value. Note Given a mask of 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1111 1111 (which means that you match on the bits where there is 0 and don't match on the bits where there is 1's). You need to translate the 1's to a decimal integer and you write 0 for each four zeros. In this example since 1111 1111 = 255, the mask would be written: as 0.0.0.255. Time Range Name If Time Range is selected, select the time range to be used. Step 7 For a IPv4-based ACL, enter the fields: Protocol Select one of the following options to create an ACL based on a specific protocol: Any (IP)\u2014Accept all IP protocols packets TCP\u2014Accept Transmission Control Protocols packets UDP\u2014Accept User Datagram Protocols packets ICMP\u2014Accept ICMP Protocols packets IGMP\u2014Accept IGMP Protocols packets Source Port for TCP/UDP Select a port from the drop-down list. Destination Port for TCP/UDP Select a port from the drop-down list. Source IP Address Select Any if all source address are acceptable or User defined to enter a source address or range of source addresses. Source IP Value Enter the IP address to which the source IP address is to be matched. Source IP Wildcard Mask Enter the mask to define a range of IP addresses. Note that this mask is different than in other uses, such as subnet mask. Here, setting a bit as 1 indicates don't care and 0 indicates to mask that value. Destination IP Address Select Any if all IP address are acceptable or User defined to enter a destination IP address or range of destination IP addresses. Destination IP Value Enter the IP value to which the destination IP value is to be matched. Destination IP Wildcard Mask Enter the mask to define a range of IP addresses. Note that this mask is different than in other uses, such as subnet mask. Here, setting a bit as 1 indicates don't care and 0 indicates to mask that value. Time Range Name If Time Range is selected, select the time range to be used. Step 8 Click Next. Step 9 Confirm that you want the ACL and ACE to be created. The details of the ACL rule are displayed. You can click Add another rule to this ACL to add another rule. Step 10 Click Next and enter the ACL Binding information: Binding Type\u2014Select one of the following options to bind the ACL: Physical interfaces only\u2014Bind the ACL to a port. In this case, click a port or ports on which to bind the ACL. VLANs only\u2014Bind the ACL to a VLAN. Enter the list of VLANs in the Enter the list of VLANs you want to bind the ACL to field. No binding\u2014Do not bind the ACL. Click Apply. A message will appear showing that the changes were applied successfully. Note If the changes are not successful, the following pop-up message will appear: Cannot bind ACL/policy map to an interface when DoS Prevention is enabled in per-port mode.",

    "page_content": "SPAN The SPAN feature, which is sometimes called port mirroring or port monitoring, selects network traffic for analysis by a network analyzer. The network analyzer can be a Cisco Switch Probe device or other Remote Monitoring (RMON) probes. Port mirroring is used on a network device to send a copy of network packets, seen on a single device port, multiple device ports, or an entire VLAN, to a network monitoring connection on another port on the device. This is commonly used when monitoring of network traffic, such as for an intrusion-detection system, is required. A network analyzer, connected to the monitoring port, processes the data packets. A packet, which is received on a network port and assigned to a VLAN that is subject to mirroring, is mirrored to the analyzer port even if the packet was eventually trapped or discarded. Packets sent by the device are mirrored when Transmit (Tx) mirroring is activated. Mirroring does not guarantee that all traffic from the source port(s) is received on the analyzer (destination) port. If more data is sent to the analyzer port than it can support, some data might be lost. RSPAN VLAN SPAN Session Destinations SPAN Session Sources RSPAN VLAN An RSPAN VLAN carries SPAN traffic between RSPAN source and destination sessions and must be defined on the start, intermediate and final devices. Note A VLAN must be added to the VLAN Database using the VLAN Settings screen before it can be configured as an RSPAN VLAN. To configure a VLAN as an RSPAN VLAN, follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Status and Statistics > SPAN & RSPAN > RSPAN VLAN. to view the previously defined RSPAN VLAN. Step 2 To configure a VLAN as a RSPAN VLAN, select it from the RSPAN VLAN drop-down list of VLANs. Step 3 Click Apply. SPAN Session Destinations A monitoring session consists of one or more source ports and a single destination ports. A destination port must be configured on the start and final devices. On the start device, this is the reflector port. On the final device, it is the analyzer port. To add a destination port, follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Status and Statistics > SPAN & RSPAN > Session Destinations. Step 2 In the Session Destinations Table, click Add. Step 3 Enter the following fields: Session ID\u2014Select a session ID. This must match the session IDs of the source ports. Port \u2014 Select the port from the drop down list. Network Traffic\u2014Select to enable that traffic other than monitored traffic is possible on the port. Step 4 Click Apply. SPAN Session Sources In a single local SPAN or RSPAN session source, you can monitor the port traffic, such as received (Rx), transmitted (Tx), or bidirectional (both). The switch supports any number of source ports (up to the maximum number of available ports on the switch) and any number of source VLANs. To configure the source ports to be mirrored, follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Status and Statistics > SPAN >Session Sources. Step 2 Select the Session ID.

    "page_content": "RMON Remote Networking Monitoring (RMON) enables an SNMP agent in the device to proactively monitor traffic statistics over a given period and send traps to an SNMP manager. The local SNMP agent compares actual, real-time counters against predefined thresholds and generates alarms, without the need for polling by a central SNMP management platform. This is an effective mechanism for proactive management, provided that you have set the correct thresholds relative to your network\u2019s base line. RMON decreases the traffic between the manager and the device since the SNMP manager does not have to poll the device frequently for information, and enables the manager to get timely status reports, since the device reports events as they occur. With this feature, you can perform the following actions: View the current statistics (from the time that the counter values cleared). You can also collect the values of these counters over a period of time, and then view the table of collected data, where each collected set is a single line of the History tab. Define interesting changes in counter values, such as \u201creached a certain number of late collisions\u201d (defines the alarm), and then specify what action to perform when this event occurs (log, trap, or log and trap). Statistics History Events Alarms Statistics The Statistics page displays detailed information regarding packet sizes and information regarding physical layer errors. The information is displayed according to the RMON standard. An oversized packet is defined as an Ethernet frame with the following criteria: Packet length is greater than MRU byte size. Collision event has not been detected. Late collision event has not been detected. Received (Rx) error event has not been detected. Packet has a valid CRC. To view RMON statistics and/or set the refresh rate, complete the following: Procedure Step 1 Click Status and Statistics > RMON > Statistics. Step 2 Select the Interface for which Ethernet statistics are to be displayed. Step 3 Select the Refresh Rate, which is the time period that passes before the interface statistics are refreshed. The following statistics are displayed for the selected interface. Bytes Received Octets received, including bad packets and FCS octets, but excluding framing bits. Drop Events Packets dropped. Packets Received Good packets received including Multicast and Broadcast packets. Broadcast Packets Received Good Broadcast packets received. This number does not include Multicast packets. Multicast Packets Received Good Multicast packets received. CRC & Align Errors CRC and Align errors that have occurred. Undersize Packets Undersized packets (less than 64 octets) received. Oversize Packets Oversized packets (over 2000 octets) received. Fragments Fragments (packets with less than 64 octets, excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets) received. Jabbers Received packets that are longer than 1632 octets. This number excludes frame bits, but includes FCS octets that had either a bad FCS (Frame Check Sequence) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral octet (Alignment Error) number. A Jabber packet is defined as an Ethernet frame that satisfies the following criteria: Collisions Collisions received. If Jumbo frames are enabled, the threshold of Jabber frames is raised to the maximum size of Jumbo frames. Frames of 64 Bytes Frames, containing 64 bytes that were sent or received. Frames of 65 to 127 Bytes Frames, containing 65-127 bytes that were sent or received. Frames of 128 to 255 Bytes Frames, containing 128-255 bytes that were sent or received. Frames of 256 to 511 Bytes Frames, containing 256-511 bytes that were sent or received. Frames of 512 to 1023 Bytes Frames, containing 512-1023 bytes that were sent or received. Frames of 1024 Bytes or More Frames, containing 1024-2000 bytes, and Jumbo Frames, that were sent or received. Note If one of the fields above shows a number of errors (not 0), a Last Update time is displayed. Step 4 To manage counters in a table view or graphic view: Click Clear Interface Counters to clear the data. Click Refresh to refresh the data. Click View All Interfaces Statistics to see all ports in table view. Click Graphic View to display these results in graphic form. In this view, you can select the Time Span for which the results will be displayed and the type of statistic to be displayed. History The RMON feature enables monitoring statistics per interface. The History page defines the sampling frequency, amount of samples to store and the port from which to gather the data. After the data is sampled and stored, it appears in the History Table page that can be viewed by clicking History Table. To enter RMON control information, complete the following: Procedure Step 1 Click Status and Statistics < RMON < History. The fields displayed on this page are defined in the Add RMON History page, below. The only field is that is on this page and not defined in the Add page is: Current Number of Samples-RMON is allowed by the standard not to grant all requested samples, but rather to limit the number of samples per request. Therefore, this field represents the sample number granted to the request that is equal or less than the requested value. Step 2 Click Add. Step 3 Enter the parameters. New History Entry-Displays the number of the new History table entry. Source Interface-Select the type of interface from which the history samples are to be taken. Max No. of Samples to Keep-Enter the number of samples to store. Sampling Interval-Enter the time in seconds that samples are collected from the ports. The field range is 1-3600. Owner-Enter the RMON station or user that requested the RMON information. Step 4 Click Apply. The entry is added to the History Control Table page, and the Running Configuration file is updated. Step 5 Click History Table to view the actual statistics. Step 6 Click History Control Table to view the History Control Table. Step 7 From the History Entry No. drop down menu, optionally select the entry number of the sample to display. The fields are displayed for the selected sample. Owner-History table entry owner. Sample No.-Statistics taken from this sample. Drop Events-Dropped packets due to lack of network resources during the sampling interval. This may not represent the exact number of dropped packets, but rather the number of times dropped packets detected. Bytes Received-Octets received including bad packets and FCS octets, but excluding framing bits. Packets Received-Packets received, including bad packets, Multicast, and Broadcast packets. Broadcast Packets-Good Broadcast packets excluding Multicast packets. Multicast Packets-Good Multicast packets received. CRC Align Errors-CRC and Align errors that have occurred. Undersize Packets-Undersized packets (less than 64 octets) received. Oversize Packets-Oversized packets (over 2000 octets) received. Fragments-Fragments (packets with less than 64 octets) received, excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets. Jabbers-Total number of received packets that longer than 2000 octets. This number excludes frame bits, but includes FCS octets that had either a bad FCS (Frame Check Sequence) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral octet (Alignment Error) number. Collisions-Collisions received. Utilization-Percentage of current interface traffic compared to maximum traffic that the interface can handle. Events You can control the occurrences that trigger an alarm and the type of notification that occurs. This is performed as follows: Events Page\u2014Configures what happens when an alarm is triggered. This can be any combination of logs and traps. Alarms Page\u2014Configures the occurrences that trigger an alarm. To define RMON events, complete the following steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Status and Statistics > RMON > Events. Step 2 Click Add. Step 3 Enter the parameters. Event Entry\u2014Displays the event entry index number for the new entry. Community\u2014Enter the SNMP community string to be included when traps are sent (optional). Description\u2014Enter a name for the event. This name is used in the Add RMON Alarm page to attach an alarm to an event. Notification Type\u2014Select the type of action that results from this event. Values are: None\u2014No action occurs when the alarm goes off. Log (Event Log Table)\u2014Add a log entry to the Event Log table when the alarm is triggered. Trap (SNMP Manager and Syslog Server)\u2014Send a trap to the remote log server when the alarm goes off. Log and Trap\u2014Add a log entry to the Event Log table and send a trap to the remote log server when the alarm goes off. Owner\u2014Enter the device or user that defined the event. Step 4 Click Apply. The RMON event is saved to the Running Configuration file. Step 5 Click Event Log Table to display the log of alarms that have occurred and that have been logged. The following data will be displayed: Event Entry No.\u2014Event entry number Log No.\u2014Event log number Log Time\u2014Time of event log Description\u2014Description of event log. Alarms RMON alarms provide a mechanism for setting thresholds and sampling intervals to generate exception events on counters or any other SNMP object counter maintained by the agent. Both the rising and falling thresholds must be configured in the alarm. After a rising threshold is crossed, no rising events are generated until the companion falling threshold is crossed. After a falling alarm is issued, the next alarm is issued when a rising threshold is crossed. One or more alarms are bound to an event, which indicates the action to be taken when the alarm occurs. Alarm counters can be monitored by either absolute values or changes (delta) in the counter values. To enter RMON alarms, complete the following steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Status and Statistics > RMON > Alarms. All previously defined alarms are displayed. The fields are described in the Add RMON Alarm page below. In addition to those fields, the following field appears: Counter Value\u2014Displays the value of the statistic during the last sampling period. Step 2 Click Add. Step 3 Enter the parameters.

    "page_content": "Time Settings Note This setting is only available in the Advanced Mode view. Synchronized system clocks provide a frame of reference between all devices on the network. Network time synchronization is critical because every aspect of managing, securing, planning, and debugging a network involves determining when events occur. Without synchronized clocks, accurately correlating log files between devices when tracking security breaches or network usage is impossible. Synchronized time also reduces confusion in shared file systems, as it is important for the modification times to be consistent, regardless of the machine on which the file systems reside. For these reasons, it is important that the time configured on all of the devices on the network is accurate. Real Time Clock Some devices have an internal self-sufficient Real Time Clock (RTC) component that keeps time even when the device is shut down and not connected to a power source. This internal clock is initialized during manufacturing and can be updated by the time features of the device when the software clock is set. When a device with a functional RTC component starts up, the system clock is set to the time and date of the RTC. The RTC component is updated whenever the system clock is changed - either dynamically by the Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP), or manually. Note The device supports SNTP, and when enabled, the device dynamically synchronizes the device time with time from an SNTP server. The device operates only as an SNTP client, and cannot provide time services to other devices. System Time SNTP Unicast SNTP Multicast/Anycast SNTP Authentication Time Range Recurring Range System Time Use the System Time page to select the system time source. If the source is manual, you can enter the time here. Caution If the system time is set manually and the device is rebooted, the manual time settings must be reentered.

Various actions can be performed with these files, such as: selecting the firmware file from which the device boots, modifying various types of configuration files internally on the device, or copying files to or from an external device, such as an external server. The following are some of the types of files are found on the device: Running Configuration\u2014Contains the parameters currently being used by the device to operate. This file is modified when you change parameter values on the device. If the device is rebooted, the Running Configuration is lost. To preserve any changes you made to the device, you must save the Running Configuration to the Startup Configuration, or another file type. Startup Configuration\u2014The parameter values that saved by copying another configuration (usually the Running Configuration) to the Startup Configuration. The Startup Configuration is retained in Flash and is preserved when the device is rebooted. At this time, the Startup Configuration is copied to RAM and identified as the Running Configuration. Mirror Configuration\u2014A copy of the Startup Configuration, created by the device when the following conditions exist: The device has been operating continuously for 24 hours. No configuration changes have been made to the Running Configuration in the previous 24 hours. The Startup Configuration is identical to the Running Configuration. Only the system can copy the Startup Configuration to the Mirror Configuration. However, you can copy from the Mirror Configuration to other file types or to another device. Backup Files\u2014Manual copies of a files used for protection against system shutdown or for the maintenance of a specific operating state. For instance, you can copy the Mirror Configuration, Startup Configuration, or Running Configuration to a Backup file. The Backup exists in Flash or on a PC or USB drive and is preserved if the device is rebooted. Firmware\u2014The program that controls the operations and functionality of the device.

    "page_content": "Cisco Business Dashboard Settings Cisco Business Dashboard helps you monitor and manage your Cisco 100 to 500 Series network with the use of the Cisco Business Dashboard Manager. The Cisco Business Dashboard Manager is an add-on that automatically discovers your network and allows you to configure and monitor all supported Cisco 100 to 500 Series devices such as Cisco switches, routers, and wireless access points. You can view the Cisco Business Dashboard by clicking Request a Demo Cisco Business Dashboard Manager is a distributed application which is comprised of two separate components or applications: one or more Probes referred to as Cisco Business Dashboard Probe and a single Manager called Cisco Business Dashboard Manager. An instance of Cisco Business Dashboard Probe is installed at each site in the network, performs network discovery and communicates directly with each Cisco device. Note For detailed instructions on how to setup the Cisco Business Dashboard Manager and Probe, please consult the Cisco Business Dashboard Quick Start Guide. https:/cisco.com/go/cbd-docs Complete the following steps on the switch graphical user interface (GUI) to enable a Probe connection to a Dashboard, configure the Organization and Network name, and other information required to allow connection to the Dashboard: Procedure Step 1 Click Administration > Cisco Business Dashboard Settings. Step 2 Configure the following: Probe Operation Check to enable the Cisco Business Dashboard Probe operation. Probe Status Displays the status of the CBD probe. Possible value are Active, Inactive or Fault. If the probe status is Active then alongside the probe status \"Active\" the probe mode will also be displayed as follows: Active (Probe Managed) - The Probe performs network discovery and communicates directly with each managed device on behalf of the Dashboard. In one network you should only enable one Probe. Active (Direct Managed) - Direct managed devices will discover other devices in the broader network and connect those devices to the Dashboard automatically then those devices become manageable. You may optionally have the dashboard explicitly search the IP address ranges to discover network devices, which can be in other VLANs or subnets. Direct managed network is recommended if all your devices support direct management. Probe Version Displays the version of the Cisco Business Dashboard probe. Logging Threshold Select one of the following options (Information, Debug, Warning, or Error) from the drop-down list to limit the level of messages logged by the Cisco Business Dashboard probe agent. Only messages with the specified level or higher will be logged. All Module Logging Check to enable. This logs all communication and events between all modules. Call Home Logging Check to enable. This logs all communication between the Probe and Manger. Discovery Logging Check to enable. This logs the device discovery events and topology discovery. Services Logging Check to enable. This logs the message translation between northbound and southbound. System Logging Check to enable. This logs the core system process not covered by any of the other logs. Northbound Logging Check to enable. This logs the communication between the Manager and the Probe. Southbound Logging Check to enable. This logs the low level communication between the Probe and devices. Dashboard Connection Check to enable connection. Dashboard Status Displays the status (Connected or Disconnected) of the Cisco Business Dashboard Manager. If the Dashboard Status is \"Disconnected\" an error reason will be displayed. Here are some examples: Certificate-error- unspecified certificate verification error Certificate-error- certificate is not yet valid Certificate-error- certificate has expired Certificate-error- certificate verify failed Connection-error- Host not found (authoritative) Connection-error- No route to host Dashboard Definition Define the address of the Cisco Business Dashboard. Select one of the following: By IP address- this option requires you to enter a valid IP address to the IP Address/Name field. By Name- this option requires you to enter a host name to the IP Address/Name field. IP Address/Name Enter the name or IP address of the Cisco Business Dashboard. Dashboard Port Specify one of the following TCP ports to connect to the Dashboard. Use Default (443). User Defined (Range: 1-65535). This option is available only if a valid address is entered in the Dashboard Address field. Connection Setup Specify one of the following connection setups: Online with Web Browser Offline with Access Key Access Key ID The Access Key ID field consists of 24 hexadecimal digits. Note that the field should only allow the input of hexadecimal characters. Access Key Secret Specify the secret to use for authentication. It can be Encrypted or in Plaintext format. The Plaintext format is specified as an alphanumeric string without white-spaces (up to 160 chars). The Key ID and Secret settings must be set together. Note When applying, if the Key ID field is empty and the Secret field is not, or if the Secret field is empty and the Key ID field is not, the following error message is displayed: \u201cKey ID and Secret must be set together\u201d. Step 3 Click Apply to save the setting to the running configuration. Note The fields Organization Name, Network Name, Dashboard Address, Key ID cannot be modified if Dashboard Connection setting is enabled. To modify any of these settings clear the Dashboard Connection check box, click Apply, and redo steps 2-4 above. Display Sensitive Data as Plaintext- Click to display the sensitive data a plain text. Reset Connection - click to disconnect the current connection with the Dashboard, flush the Cisco Business Dashboard Probe cached data, and then attempt to reconnect to the Dashboard. A confirmation message is displayed before the operation starts. This control is enabled only if the Dashboard Connection and Probe Operation are enabled. Note The Reset Connection is only enabled if the Dashboard Connection and Probe Operation check boxes are checked. Clear Probe Database- Click to clear the probe data. It is enabled only if the Probe Operation checkbox is unchecked (and has been unchecked since the screen loaded). Otherwise, the button is disabled with the following tooltip: \u201cProbe Operation must be disabled prior to clearing probe database\u201d. Note Many factors affect the number of network devices and clients that the Cisco Business Dashboard Probe on a switch can manage. We recommend that a probe on a switch manage no more than 15 network devices (switches, routers, and wireless access points) and no more than 150 connected clients. If your network is more complex, we recommend that you use other platforms for the Cisco Business Dashboard Probe.

    "page_content": "Plug-n-Play (PNP) Installation of new networking devices or replacement of devices can be expensive, time-consuming and error-prone when performed manually. Typically, new devices are first sent to a central staging facility where the devices are unboxed, connected to a staging network, updated with the right licenses, configurations and images; then packaged and shipped to the actual installation location. After these processes are completed, experts must travel to the installation locations to perform the installation. Even in scenarios where the devices are installed in the NOC/Data Center itself, there may not be enough experts for the sheer number of devices. All these issues contribute to delays in deployment and add to the operational costs. Connecting to PNP Server To allow the switch to connect to the PnP server, a discovery process takes place, in which the switch discovers the PNP server address/url. There are multiple discovery methods, and they are executed by the switch according to the sequence detailed below. If a PnP server is discovered by a certain method, the discovery process is completed and the rest of the methods are not executed: User configured address- the PnP server URL or IP address are specified by the user. Address received from DHCP response option 43- the PnP server URL or IP address are received as part of option 43 in the DHCP response DNS resolution of host name \"pnpserver\"- the PnP server IP addressed is obtained via DNS server resolution of host name \u201cpnpserver\u201d. Cisco Plug and Play Connect - a redirection service that allows full \u201cout of the box\u201d PNP server discovery which runs over HTTPs. The switch contacts the redirection service using the FQDN \u201cdevicehelper.cisco.com\u201d. Cisco PnP Connect Prerequisites To allow Cisco Plug and Play Connect operation, the user needs to create devices and controller profiles in Plug and Play Connect (navigate to https:/software.cisco.com and click the PnP Connect link). Note that a Cisco Smart Account is required to use PnP Connect. To create or update a Smart Account, see the Administration section of https:/software.cisco.com. In addition, the following prerequisites are required to be met on the switch itself: The PNP server was not discovered by the other discovery methods The device is able to successfully resolve the name devicehelper.cisco.com (either static configuration or using DNS server) System time was set using one of the following methods Time was updated by an SNTP server Clock was set manually by user Time was preserved across resets by Real Time Clock (RTC). CA-Signed Certificate based Authentication Cisco distributes certificates signed by a signing authorities in .tar file format and signs the bundle with Cisco Certificate Authority (CA) signature. This certificate bundle is provided by Cisco infoSec for public downloads on cisco.com. Note If the PNP server discovery is based on Cisco PnP Connect, the trust-pool is downloaded from following: http:/www.cisco.com/security/pki/trs/ios_core.p7b. If the PNP server discovery is based on DHCP option 43, use the \u201cT<Trust pool CA bundle URL>;\u201d parameter in DHCP option 43 to provide the URL for downloading the trust pool. The certificates from this bundle can be installed on the Cisco device for server-side validation during SSL handshake. It is assumed that the server uses a certificate, which is signed by one of the CA that is available in the bundle. The PnP agent uses the built-in PKI capability to validate the certificate bundle. As the bundle is signed by Cisco CA, the agent is capable of identifying a bundle that is tampered before installing the certificates on the device. After the integrity of the bundle is ensured by the agent, the agent installs the certificates on the device. After the certificates are installed on the device, the PnP agent initiates an HTTPs connection to the server without any additional steps from the server. Note The device also supports a built in certificate bundle which is installed as part of the bootup process. this bundle can be used to validate PNP server. If a Bundle is downloaded based on Cisco PnP Connect information then the certificates from the downloaded bundle are installed and the certificates based on the built in bundle are un-installed. Note In addition to validating PNP certificate based on installed CA certificate the PNP Agent also validates that the certificate's Common Name/Subject Alternate Name (CN/SAN) matches the host name/IP address of the PNP server. If they don't match validation of certificate is rejected. Cisco PnP DHCP Option 43 Usage Guidelines DHCP option 43 is a vendor specific identifier which is one of the methods that can be used by the PnP agent to locate and connect to the PnP server (see Cisco Plug-n-Play for more information). The following provides Information on configuration of Option 43 to allow proper configuration on DHCP server. Option 43 includes the following fields/parameters: <DHCP-typecode><feature-opcode><version><debug-option>;<arglist> The <arglist> parameter should use the following syntax: B<IP address type>;I<IP address>;J<Port>;K<Transport protocol>;T<Trust pool CA bundle URL>;Z<SNTP server IP address> The following table details the description and usage of option 43 fields Parameter Description DHCP-typecode DHCP sub-option type. The DHCP sub-option type for PnP is 5. Feature-opcode Feature operation code \u2013 can be either Active (A) or Passive (P). The feature operation code for PnP is Active (A) which implies that PnP agent initiates a connection to the PnP server. If the PnP server cannot be reached, PnP agent retries until it makes a connection. Version Version of template to be used by PnP agent. Must be 1. Debug-option Turns ON or OFF the debug messages during the processing of the DHCP Option 43: D \u2013 debug option is ON; N \u2013 debug option is OFF. K Transport protocol to be used between PnP agent and PnP server: 4 - HTTP or 5 \u2013 HTTPS. B IP address type of PnP server IP address specified with the letter code \u2018I\u2019: 1- host, 2- IPv4, 3- IPv6 I IP address or host name of PnP server. If host name is specified, DNS related options must be present in the DHCP server to allow for successful use of host name. T URL of trust pool CA bundle. You can get the CA bundle from a Cisco Business Dashboard, or from a TFTP server. When using Cisco Business Dashboard, use the following URL format: http:/CBD IP address or domain name/ca/trustpool/CA_bundle_name When using TFTP Server, use the following URL format: tftp:/tftp server IP/CA_bundle_name Z SNTP server IP address. You must sync the clock before configuring a trust pool. Note The switch clock is considered synchronized if it was updated by any SNTP server supported by the switch (by default, user configured or in Z parameter) or set manually by the user. This parameter is required when using trust pool security if the switch can not reach any other SNTP server. For example, for an out-of-the box switch with factory default configuration but no Internet connectivity to reach the default SNTP servers. J Port number HTTP=80 HTTPS=443 Examples for Option 43 usage: The following format is used for PnP connection setup using HTTP: option 43 ascii 5A1N;K4;B2;I10.10.10.3;J80 The following format is used for PnP connection setup on top of HTTPS, directly using a trust pool. HTTPS can be used when the trust pool CA bundle is downloaded from a Cisco Business Dashboard and the Cisco Business Dashboard server certificate was issued by a 3rd party (not self signed). In the example below \u201c10.10.10.3\u201d is the Cisco Business Dashboard IP address. Optionally, you can specify a domain name: option 43 ascii 5A1N;K5;B2;I10.10.10.3;Thttp:/10.10.10.3/ca/trustpool/ios.p7b;Z10.75.166.1 PNP Settings PNP Session PNP Settings To configure PNP settings, follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Administration > PNP > PNP Settings.

    "page_content": "Discovery - LLDP LLDP is a protocol that enables network managers to troubleshoot and enhance network management in multi-vendor environments. LLDP standardizes methods for network devices to advertise themselves to other systems, and to store discovered information. LLDP enables a device to advertise its identification, configuration, and capabilities to neighboring devices that then store the data in a Management Information Base (MIB). LDP is a link layer protocol. By default, the device terminates and processes all incoming LLDP packets as required by the protocol. This section describes how to configure LLDP and covers the following topics: Properties Port Settings LLDP MED Network Policy LLDP MED Port Settings LLDP Port Status LLDP Local Information LLDP Neighbor Information LLDP Statistics LLDP Overloading Properties The Properties page enables entering LLDP general parameters, such as enabling/disabling the feature globally and setting timers.

The port settings are written to the Running Configuration file. LLDP MED Network Policy The LLDP-MED network policy is a related set of configuration settings for a specific real-time application such as voice, or video. A network policy, if configured, can be included in the outgoing LLDP packets to the attached LLDP media endpoint device. The media endpoint device must send its traffic as specified in the network policy it receives. For example, a policy can be created for VoIP traffic that instructs VoIP phone to: Send voice traffic on VLAN 10 as tagged packet and with 802.1p priority 5. Send voice traffic with DSCP 46. Network policies are associated with ports by using the LLDP MED Port Settings. An administrator can manually configure one or more network policies and the interfaces where the policies are to be sent. It is the administrator's responsibility to manually create the VLANs and their port memberships according to the network policies and their associated interfaces. In addition, an administrator can instruct the device to automatically generate and advertise a network policy for voice application based on the voice VLAN maintained by the device. Refer the Auto Voice VLAN section for details on how the device maintains its voice VLAN. To define an LLDP MED network policy, follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Administration > Discovery - LLDP > LLDP MED Network Policy. This page contains previously-created network policies. Step 2 Select Auto for LLDP-MED Network Policy for Voice Application if the device is to automatically generate and advertise a network policy for voice application based on the voice VLAN maintained by the device. Note When this box is checked, you may not manually configure a voice network policy. Step 3 Click Apply to add this setting to the Running Configuration file. Step 4 To define a new policy, click Add. Step 5 Enter the values: Network Policy Number\u2014Select the number of the policy to be created. Application\u2014Select the type of application (type of traffic) for which the network policy is being defined. VLAN ID\u2014Enter the VLAN ID to which the traffic must be sent. (Range 0 - 4095) VLAN Type\u2014Select whether the traffic is Tagged or Untagged. User Priority\u2014Select the traffic priority applied to traffic defined by this network policy. This is the CoS value. DSCP Value\u2014Select the DSCP value to associate with application data sent by neighbors. This value informs them how they must mark the application traffic they send to the device. Step 6 Click Apply. The network policy is defined. Note You must manually configure the interfaces to include the desired manually-defined network policies for the outgoing LLDP packets using the LLDP MED Port Settings. LLDP MED Port Settings Note This setting is only available in the Advanced Mode view. The LLDP MED Port Settings page enables configuration of the LLDP-MED TLVs. Network policies are configured using the LLDP MED Network Policy page. Note If LLDP-MED Network Policy for Voice Application is Auto and Auto Voice VLAN is in operation, then the device automatically generates an LLDP-MED Network Policy for Voice Application for all the LLDP ports. LLDP-MED enabled and are members of the voice VLAN. To configure LLDP MED on each port, proceed as follows: Procedure Step 1 Click Administration > Discovery - LLDP > LLDP MED Port Settings. Step 2 The message at the top of the page indicates whether the generation of the LLDP MED Network Policy for the voice application is automatic or not. Click on the link to change the mode.

A network policy, if configured, can be included in the outgoing LLDP packets to the attached LLDP media endpoint device. The media endpoint device must send its traffic as specified in the network policy it receives. For example, a policy can be created for VoIP traffic that instructs VoIP phone to: Send voice traffic on VLAN 10 as tagged packet and with 802.1p priority 5. Send voice traffic with DSCP 46. Network policies are associated with ports by using the LLDP MED Port Settings. An administrator can manually configure one or more network policies and the interfaces where the policies are to be sent. It is the administrator's responsibility to manually create the VLANs and their port memberships according to the network policies and their associated interfaces. In addition, an administrator can instruct the device to automatically generate and advertise a network policy for voice application based on the voice VLAN maintained by the device. Refer the Auto Voice VLAN section for details on how the device maintains its voice VLAN. To define an LLDP MED network policy, follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Administration > Discovery - LLDP > LLDP MED Network Policy. This page contains previously-created network policies. Step 2 Select Auto for LLDP-MED Network Policy for Voice Application if the device is to automatically generate and advertise a network policy for voice application based on the voice VLAN maintained by the device.

    "page_content": "Discovery - CDP Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2, media-independent, and network-independent protocol that networking applications use to learn about nearby, directly connected devices. Cisco Discovery Protocol is enabled by default. Each device configured for Cisco Discovery Protocol advertises at least one address at which the device can receive messages and sends periodic advertisements (messages) to the well-known multicast address 01:00:0C:CC:CC:CC. Devices discover each other by listening at that address. They also listen to messages to learn when interfaces on other devices are up or go down. Advertisements contain time-to-live information, which indicates the length of time a receiving device should hold Cisco Discovery Protocol information before discarding it. Advertisements supported and configured in Cisco software are sent, by default, every 60 seconds on interfaces that support Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAP) headers. Cisco devices never forward Cisco Discovery Protocol packets. Cisco devices that support Cisco Discovery Protocol store the information received in a table. Information in this table is refreshed every time an advertisement is received, and information about a device is discarded after three advertisements from that device are missed. This section describes how to configure CDP. Properties Interface Settings CDP Local Information CDP Neighbors Information CDP Statistics Properties Similar to LLDP, the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) is a link layer protocol for directly connected neighbors to advertise themselves and their capabilities to each other. Unlike LLDP, CDP is a Cisco proprietary protocol. To configure the CDP properties, complete the following steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Administration > Discovery - CDP > Properties. Step 2 Enter the parameters. CDP Status Select to enable CDP on the device. CDP Frames Handling If CDP is not enabled, select the action to be taken if a packet that matches the selected criteria is received: Bridging\u2014Forward the packet based on the VLAN Filtering\u2014Delete the packet Flooding\u2014VLAN unaware flooding that forwards incoming CDP packets to all the ports excluding the ingress ports. CDP Voice VLAN Advertisement Select to enable the device to advertise the voice VLAN in CDP on all of the ports that are CDP enabled, and are member of the voice VLAN. The voice VLAN is configured in the Properties. CDP Mandatory TLVs Validation If selected, incoming CDP packets not containing the mandatory TLVs are discarded and the invalid error counter is incremented. CDP Version Select the version of CDP to use. CDP Hold Time Amount of time that CDP packets are held before the packets are discarded, measured in multiples of the TLV Advertise Interval. For example, if the TLV Advertise Interval is 30 seconds, and the Hold Multiplier is 4, then the LLDP packets are discarded after 120 seconds. The following options are possible: Use Default\u2014Use the default time (180 seconds) User Defined\u2014Enter the time in seconds. CDP Transmission Rate The rate in seconds at which CDP advertisement updates are sent. The following options are possible: Use Default\u2014Use the default rate (60 seconds) User Defined\u2014Enter the rate in seconds. Device ID Format Select the format of the device ID (MAC address or serial number). The following options are possible: Mac Address\u2014Use the MAC address of the device as the device ID. Serial Number\u2014Use the serial number of the device as the device ID. Hostname\u2014Use the host name of the device as the device ID. Source Interface IP address to be used in the TLV of the frames. The following options are possible: Use Default\u2014Use the IP address of the outgoing interface. User Defined\u2014Use the IP address of the interface (in the Interface field) in the address TLV. Interface IF User Defined was selected for Source Interface, select the interface. Syslog Voice VLAN Mismatch Check to send a SYSLOG message when a voice VLAN mismatch is detected. This means that the voice VLAN information in the incoming frame does not match what the local device is advertising. Syslog Native VLAN Mismatch Check to send a SYSLOG message when a native VLAN mismatch is detected. This means that the native VLAN information in the incoming frame does not match what the local device is advertising. Syslog Duplex Mismatch Check to send a SYSLOG message when duplex information is mismatched. This means that the duplex information in the incoming frame does not match what the local device is advertising. Step 3 Click Apply. The LLDP properties are defined. Interface Settings Note This setting is only available in the Advanced Mode view. The Interface Settings page enables you to enable/disable CDP per port. By setting these properties, it\u2019s possible to select the types of information to be provided to devices that support the LLDP protocol. The LLDP-MED TLVs to be advertised can be selected in the LLDP MED Port Settings. To define the CDP interface settings: Procedure Step 1 Click Administration > Discovery - CDP > Interface Settings.

This means that the voice VLAN information in the incoming frame doesn\u2019t match what the local device is advertising. Syslog Native VLAN Mismatch\u2014Select to enable sending a SYSLOG message when a native VLAN mismatch is detected. This means that the native VLAN information in the incoming frame doesn\u2019t match what the local device is advertising. Syslog Duplex Mismatch\u2014Select to enable sending a SYSLOG message when duplex information mismatch is detected. This means that the duplex information in the incoming frame doesn\u2019t match what the local device is advertising. Step 3 Enter the relevant information, and click Apply. The port settings are written to the Running Configuration. CDP Local Information To view information that is advertised by the CDP protocol about the local device: Procedure Click Administration > Discovery - CDP > CDP Local Information.

    "page_content": "Link Aggregation Link aggregation applies to various methods of combining multiple network connections in parallel in order to increase throughput beyond what a single connection could sustain. It provides redundancy in case one of the links should fail. Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) is part of the IEEE specification (802.3ad) that enables you to bundle several ports together to form a single logical channel (LAG). LAGs multiply bandwidth, increase port flexibility, and provide link redundancy between two devices. Two types of LAGs are supported: Static\u2014The ports in the LAG are manually configured. A LAG is static if LACP is disabled on it. The group of ports assigned to a static LAG are always active members. After a LAG is manually created, the LACP option can\u2019t be added or removed, until the LAG is edited and a member is removed (which can be added back prior to applying); the LACP button then become available for editing. Dynamic\u2014A LAG is dynamic if LACP is enabled on it. The group of ports assigned to dynamic LAG are candidate ports. LACP determines which candidate ports are active member ports. The nonactive candidate ports are standby ports ready to replace any failing active member ports. This section describes how to configure LAGs. LAG Management LAG Settings LACP LAG Management Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) is part of the IEEE specification (802.3ad) that enables you to bundle several ports together to form a single logical channel (LAG).

    "page_content": "PoE A PoE device is Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE) that delivers electrical power to a connected Pod Devices (PD) over existing copper cables without interfering with the network traffic, updating the physical network or modifying the network infrastructure. PoE provides the following features: Eliminates the need to run 110/220 V AC power to all devices on a wired LAN. Eliminates the need to deploy double cabling systems in an enterprise significantly decreasing installation costs. Power over Ethernet can be used in any enterprise network that deploys relatively low-pod devices connected to the Ethernet LAN, such as: IP phones, Wireless access points, IP gateways, Audio and video remote monitoring devices. PoE implements in the following stages: Detection\u2014Sends special pulses on the copper cable. When a PoE device is located at the other end, that device responds to these pulses. Classification\u2014Negotiation between the Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE) and the Pod Device (PD) commences after the Detection stage. During negotiation, the PD specifies its class, which indicates maximum amount of power that the PD consumes. Power Consumption\u2014After the classification stage completes, the PSE provides power to the PD. If the PD supports PoE, but without classification, it is assumed to be class 0 (the maximum). If a PD tries to consume more power than permitted by the standard, the PSE stops supplying power to the port. PoE supports two modes: Port Limit\u2014The maximum power the device agrees to supply is limited to the value the system administrator configures, regardless of the Classification result. Class Power Limit\u2014The maximum power the device agrees to supply is determined by the results of the Classification stage. This means that it is set as per the Client's request. Warning The PoE unit is to be connected only to PoE networks without routing to the outside plant. Properties PoE Settings PoE Statistics Properties Note This section is only relevant for devices supporting PoE. The PoE Properties page enables selecting either the Port Limit or Class Limit PoE mode and specifying the PoE traps to be generated. These settings are entered in advance. When the PD actually connects and is consuming power, it might consume much less than the maximum power allowed. Output power is disabled during power-on reboot, initialization, and system configuration to ensure that PDs aren\u2019t damaged. To configure PoE on the device and monitor current power usage: Procedure Step 1 Click Port Management > PoE > Properties. Step 2 Enter the values for the following fields: Power Mode\u2014Select one of the following options: Class Limit\u2014Maximum power limit per port is determined by the class of the device, which results from the Classification stage. Port Limit\u2014Maximum power limit per each port is configured by the user. Note When you change from Port Limit to Class Limit or conversely, disable the PoE ports, and enable them after changing the power configuration. Traps\u2014Check Enable to enable traps. If traps are enabled, you must also enable SNMP and configure at least one SNMP Notification Recipient. Power Trap Threshold\u2014Enter the usage threshold that is a percentage of the power limit. An alarm is initiated if the power exceeds this value. The following PoE power information is displayed for the device: Nominal Power\u2014Total amount of power the device can supply to all the connected PDs. Allocated power\u2014The amount of the power that is currently allocated to the PoE ports. The allocated power is calculated by summing the power that is allocated to each of the PoE ports. If the port negotiated power allocation with PD using CDP or LLDP then the port power allocation is based on the results of the CDP or LLDP negotiation. If the port did not negotiate the power using CDP or LLDP then the power allocated to the port equals the PD consumed power. Available Power\u2014Nominal power minus the amount of consumed power. Note Power allocation based on LLDP negotiation may be higher than the negotiated power value. Power allocation based on CDP negotiation will be equal to the negotiated power value. The power allocated per port (if different from the consumed power value) is indicated in parentheses in the \u201cPower\u201d column (PoE Setting Table). Software Version\u2014Displays the software version of the PoE chip. PSE Chipset & Hardware Revision\u2014PoE chipset and hardware revision number. Step 3 Click Apply to save the PoE properties. PoE Settings The Persistent PoE feature (also referred to as Always On PoE) minimizes the dependency of the PoE operation on the switch\u2019s status. Before the introduction of this feature, any disruption in the switch operation such as a reboot or fatal error would also cause a disruption in the PoE operation until the device finished coming back up. With the persistent PoE, warm reboots such as the ones performed by the reload command or the reboot feature in the GUI will not disrupt the operation of the PoE in it\u2019s current state. The PoE Settings displays the system information for enabling PoE on the interfaces. It monitors the power usage and maximum power limit per port when the PoE mode is Port Limit. When the power consumed on the port exceeds the port limit, the port power is turned off. To configure PoE settings, follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Port Management > PoE > Settings . Step 2 Select a port and click Edit. Step 3 Enter the value for the following field: Note Ports are displayed with relevant PoE information. These fields are described in the Edit page except for the following fields: Administrative Power Allocation (mW)\u2014Enter the amount of power that can be allocated.

Time Range Name\u2014If Time Range has been enabled, select the time range to be used. Click Edit to go to the Time Range page. Priority Level\u2014Select the port priority: low, high, or critical, for use when the power supply is low. For example, if the power supply is running at 99% usage and port 1 is prioritized as high, but port 3 is prioritized as low, port 1 receives power and port 3 might be denied power. Class\u2014Displays the class of the device, which indicates the maximum power level of the device. Max Power Allocation\u2014This field appears only if the Power Mode set in the PoE Properties page is Power Limit. Displays the maximum amount of power permitted on this port. Negotiated Power\u2014Power allocated to device. Note The \"expired\" warning may appear alongside the Watt value when power is allocated to the device via CDP or LLDP negotiation. When the switch stops receiving negotiation packets from the powered device, the port enters the expired state. If this happens, the port will supply power based on the most recent negotiation packet received from this device. If the device resends the negotiation packet, the port will exit the expired state and apply power based on the information in the new packet. Power Negotiation Protocol\u2014Protocol determining the negotiated power. Power Consumption\u2014Displays the amount of power in milliwatts assigned Settings (Class Limit) Step 4 Click Apply.

The Green Ethernet feature can reduce overall power usage in the following ways: Energy-Detect Mode\u2014On an inactive link, the port moves into inactive mode, saving power while keeping the administrative status of the port Up. Recovery from this mode to full operational mode is fast, transparent, and no frames are lost. This mode is disabled by default. Short-Reach Mode\u2014This feature provides for power savings on a short length of cable. After cable length is analyzed, the power usage is adjusted for various cable lengths. If the cable is shorter than 30 meter for 10 gigabit ports and 50 meter for other type of ports, the device uses less power to send frames over the cable, thus saving energy. This mode is only supported on RJ45 ports; it does not apply to Combo ports. This mode is disabled by default. In addition to the above Green Ethernet features, the 802.3az Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE). EEE reduces power consumption when there is no traffic on the port. EEE is enabled globally by default. Power savings, current power consumption and cumulative energy saved can be monitored. The total amount of saved energy can be viewed as a percentage of the power that would have been consumed by the physical interfaces had they not been running in Green Ethernet mode. The saved energy displayed is only related to Green Ethernet. The amount of energy saved by EEE is not displayed.

The broadcast domains can communicate with one another via a Layer 3 device such as a router. A VLAN is primarily used to form groups among hosts regardless of their physical location. As a result of group formation among hosts, a VLAN improves security. When a VLAN is created, it has no effect until it is manually or dynamically attached to at least one port. One of the most common reasons for establishing a VLAN is to create a separate VLAN for voice and another for data. This directs both types of packets. Create or Configure a VLAN To create a VLAN or configure a VLAN on a switch, follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click VLAN Management > VLAN Settings. Step 2 Click Add to add one or more new VLANs. Step 3 To create a single VLAN, select the VLAN radio button, enter the VLAN ID, and optionally the VLAN Name. Step 4 Add the following fields for the new VLANs. VLAN Interface State- Check to enable the VLAN. Link Status SNMP Traps- Check to enable link-status generation of SNMP traps. Note In the VLAN Table, the term Originators will be displayed which indicates how the VLAN was created. Step 5 To add a range of VLANs, check Range and enter a VLAN Range (Range 2 - 4094) in the VLAN range field. Step 6 Click Apply to create the VLAN(s).

    "page_content": "Voice VLAN The voice VLAN feature allows IP voice traffic from an IP phone to be carried by access ports. When an IP Phone is connected to the switch, it sends voice traffic with Layer 3 IP precedence and Layer 2 class of service (CoS) values of 5, which are both set by default. Because uneven data transmission can degrade the sound quality of an IP phone call, the switch supports quality of service (QoS) based on IEEE 802.1p CoS. To send network traffic from the switch in a predictable manner, QoS employs classification and scheduling. Using LLDP-MED Network rules, voice VLAN can propagate the CoS/802.1p and DSCP settings. If an appliance sends LLDP-MED packets, the LLDP-MED is set by default to respond with the Voice QoS option. The voice traffic sent by MED-supported devices must have the same CoS/802.1p and DSCP parameters as those received with the LLDP-MED response. You can use your own network settings and turn off automatic updating between Voice VLAN and LLDP-MED. The device can further set the mapping and remarking (CoS/802.1p) of the voice traffic based on the OUI when used in OUI mode. By default, all interfaces are CoS/802.1p trusted. The device applies the quality of service based on the CoS/802.1p value found in the voice stream. For Telephony OUI voice streams, you can override the quality of service and optionally remark the 802.1p of the voice streams by specifying the desired CoS/802.1p values and using the remarking option under Telephony OUI. Properties Auto Voice VLAN Telephony OUI Telephone OUI Interface Properties Use the Voice VLAN Properties page for the following: View how voice VLAN is currently configured.

Note Manually reconfiguring the voice VLAN ID, CoS/802.1p, and/or DSCP from their default values results in a static voice VLAN, which has higher priority than auto voice VLAN. Step 3 Click Apply. The VLAN properties are written to the Running Configuration file. Auto Voice VLAN Auto Voice VLAN is responsible to maintain the voice VLAN, but depends on Auto Smartport to maintain the voice VLAN port memberships. Auto Voice VLAN performs the following functions when it is in operation: When activated, Auto Voice VLAN performs the following tasks: It finds information about voice VLANs in CDP advertisements from directly connected neighbor devices. If multiple neighbor switches and/or routers advertise their voice VLAN, such as Cisco Unified Communication (UC) devices, the voice VLAN from the device with the lowest MAC address is used. If Auto Voice VLAN mode is enabled, use the Auto Voice VLAN page to view the relevant global and interface parameters. You can also use this page to manually restart Auto Voice VLAN, by clicking Restart Auto Voice VLAN. After a short delay, this resets the voice VLAN to the default voice VLAN and restarts the Auto Voice VLAN discovery and synchronization process on all the switches in the LAN that are Auto Voice VLAN enabled. Note This only resets the voice VLAN to the default voice VLAN if the Source Type is in the Inactive state. To view Auto Voice VLAN parameters: Procedure Step 1 Click VLAN Management > Voice VLAN > Auto Voice VLAN. The Operational Status block on this page shows the information about the current voice VLAN and its source: Auto Voice VLAN Status\u2014Displays whether Auto Voice VLAN is enabled. Voice VLAN ID\u2014The identifier of the current voice VLAN Source Type\u2014Displays the type of source where the voice VLAN is discovered by the root device.

The following options are available: Yes\u2014The device uses this voice VLAN to synchronize with other Auto Voice VLAN-enabled switches. This voice VLAN is the voice VLAN for the network unless a voice VLAN from a higher priority source is discovered. Only one local source is the best local source. No\u2014This isn\u2019t the best local source. Step 3 Click Refresh to refresh the information on the page Telephony OUI When traffic from Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) equipment is assigned to a specific VLAN made up of voice devices such as IP phones, VoIP endpoints, and voice systems, the Voice Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) is used.The switch can detect and add port members to the Voice VLAN automatically, as well as assign the configured Quality of Service (QoS) to packets from the Voice VLAN. IP routers are required to provide communication between voice devices that are in different Voice VLANs. Organizationally Unique Identifiers (OUI) can be used to add a specific manufacturer's Media Access Control (MAC) address to the OUI table. The first three bytes of the MAC address contain a manufacturer identifier, while the last three bytes contain a unique station ID. Once the OUIs are added to the table, any voice received from a specific IP phone on the ports of the voice VLAN ports is forwarded on the voice VLAN, provided that IP phone is listed in the OUI table The source MAC address of a received packet is checked by the switch to determine whether it is a voice packet. The source MAC address of VoIP traffic contains a preconfigured OUI prefix. You can manually enter MAC addresses and descriptions for specific manufacturers into the OUI table. All traffic received on the Voice VLAN ports from a specific IP phone with a listed OUI is routed to the Voice VLAN. To configure Telephony OUI and/or add a new Voice VLAN OUI follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click VLAN Management > Voice VLAN > Telephony OUI. The Telephony OUI page contains the following fields: Telephony OUI Operational Status\u2014Displays whether OUIs are used to identify voice traffic.

Auto Voice VLAN performs the following functions when it is in operation: When activated, Auto Voice VLAN performs the following tasks: It finds information about voice VLANs in CDP advertisements from directly connected neighbor devices. If multiple neighbor switches and/or routers advertise their voice VLAN, such as Cisco Unified Communication (UC) devices, the voice VLAN from the device with the lowest MAC address is used. If Auto Voice VLAN mode is enabled, use the Auto Voice VLAN page to view the relevant global and interface parameters. You can also use this page to manually restart Auto Voice VLAN, by clicking Restart Auto Voice VLAN. After a short delay, this resets the voice VLAN to the default voice VLAN and restarts the Auto Voice VLAN discovery and synchronization process on all the switches in the LAN that are Auto Voice VLAN enabled. Note This only resets the voice VLAN to the default voice VLAN if the Source Type is in the Inactive state. To view Auto Voice VLAN parameters: Procedure Step 1 Click VLAN Management > Voice VLAN > Auto Voice VLAN.

IP routers are required to provide communication between voice devices that are in different Voice VLANs. Organizationally Unique Identifiers (OUI) can be used to add a specific manufacturer's Media Access Control (MAC) address to the OUI table. The first three bytes of the MAC address contain a manufacturer identifier, while the last three bytes contain a unique station ID. Once the OUIs are added to the table, any voice received from a specific IP phone on the ports of the voice VLAN ports is forwarded on the voice VLAN, provided that IP phone is listed in the OUI table The source MAC address of a received packet is checked by the switch to determine whether it is a voice packet. The source MAC address of VoIP traffic contains a preconfigured OUI prefix. You can manually enter MAC addresses and descriptions for specific manufacturers into the OUI table. All traffic received on the Voice VLAN ports from a specific IP phone with a listed OUI is routed to the Voice VLAN.

Normally, it falls to the network administrator to ensure that all surveillance devices are connected to the same VLAN and to setup this VLAN and the interfaces on it to allow for this high priority traffic. The Auto Surveillance VLAN (ASV) feature automates aspects of this setup by detecting surveillance devices on the network, assigning them to a VLAN and setting their traffic priority. ASV General Settings ASV Interface Settings ASV General Settings The user defines surveillance traffic on their network by creating a list of OUIs and MAC addresses. Any traffic on interfaces with the feature enabled whose source matches one of the OUIs or MAC addresses is considered surveillance traffic. Up to 32 sources for surveillance traffic can be defined in any combination of MAC and OUIs. Configuring ASV When activating the feature, the users must select an existing Static VLAN to be designated as the ASV VLAN. The user then sets the CoS for traffic in this VLAN and the aging time for the VLAN membership. Finally, the ASV feature should be activated on the interfaces expected to receive surveillance traffic. To configure the ASV general settings, follow these steps. Procedure Step 1 Click VLAN Management > Auto-Surveillance VLAN > ASV General Settings. Step 2 From the drop-down menu, select the Auto Surveillance-VLAN ID. This setting is used to select the ASV VLAN ID. If None is selected, the feature is disabled. Step 3 Enter the CoS.

    "page_content": "MSTP Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP) is used to separate the spanning tree protocol (STP) port state between various domains (on different VLANs). For example, while port A is blocked in one STP instance due to a loop on VLAN A, the same port can be placed in the Forwarding State in another STP instance. The MSTP Properties page enables you to define the global MSTP settings. Multiple STP (MSTP) - MSTP is based on RSTP. It detects Layer 2 loops, and attempts to mitigate them by preventing the involved port from transmitting traffic. Since loops exist on a per-Layer 2-domain basis, a situation can occur when a port is blocked to eliminate a STP loop. Traffic will be forwarded to the port that is not blocked, and no traffic will be forwarded to the port that is blocked. This is not an efficient usage of bandwidth as the blocked port will always be unused. MSTP solves this problem by enabling several STP instances, so that it is possible to detect and mitigate loops separately in each instance. This enables a port to be blocked for one or more STP instances but non blocked for other STP instances. If different VLANs are associated with different STP instances, then their traffic will be relayed based on the STP port state of their associated MST instances. Better bandwidth utilization results. MSTP Properties MSTP Instance Settings MSTP Interface Settings VLAN to MSTP Instance MSTP Properties The global MSTP configures a separate Spanning Tree for each VLAN group and blocks all but one of the possible alternate paths within each spanning tree instance. MSTP enables formation of MST regions that can run multiple MST instances (MSTI). Multiple regions and other STP bridges are interconnected using one single common spanning tree (CST). MSTP is fully compatible with RSTP bridges, in that an MSTP BPDU can be interpreted by an RSTP bridge as an RSTP BPDU. This not only enables compatibility with RSTP bridges without configuration changes, but also causes any RSTP bridges outside of an MSTP region to see the region as a single RSTP bridge, regardless of the number of MSTP bridges inside the region itself. For two or more switches to be in the same MST region, they must have the same VLANs to MST instance mapping, configuration revision number, and region name. Switches intended to be in the same MST region are never separated by switches from another MST region. If they are separated, the region becomes two separate regions. This mapping can be done in the MSTP Instance Settings. Use this page if the system operates in MSTP mode. To define MSTP, follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Spanning Tree > MSTP > MSTP Properties. Step 2 Enter the parameters. Region Name\u2014Define an MSTP region name.

    "page_content": "Multicast Properties Multicast forwarding enables one-to-many information dissemination. Multicast applications are useful for dissemination of information to multiple clients, where clients do not require reception of the entire content. A typical application is a cable-TV-like service, where clients can join a channel in the middle of a transmission, and leave before it ends. The data is sent only to relevant ports. Forwarding the data only to the relevant ports conserves bandwidth and host resources on links. By default, all Multicast frames are flooded to all ports of the VLAN. It is possible to selectively forward only to relevant ports and filter (drop) the Multicast on the rest of the ports by enabling the Bridge Multicast filtering status in this section. Multicast addresses have the following properties: Each IPv4 Multicast address is in the address range 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255. The IPv6 Multicast address is FF00:/8. To map an IP Multicast group address to an Layer 2 Multicast address: For IPv4, this is mapped by taking the 23 low-order bits from the IPv4 address, and adding them to the 01:00:5e prefix. By standard, the upper nine bits of the IP address are ignored, and any IP addresses that only differ in the value of these upper bits are mapped to the same Layer 2 address, since the lower 23 bits that are used are identical. For example, 234.129.2.3 is mapped to a MAC Multicast group address 01:00:5e:01:02:03. Up to 32 IP Multicast group addresses can be mapped to the same Layer 2 address. For IPv6, this is mapped by taking the 32 low-order bits of the Multicast address, and adding the prefix of 33:33. For example, the IPv6 Multicast address FF00:1122:3344 is mapped to Layer 2 Multicast 33:33:11:22:33:44. To enable Multicast filtering, and select the forwarding method, follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Multicast > Properties. Step 2 Enter the parameters. Bridge Multicast Filtering Status Select Enable to enable filtering. VLAN ID Select the VLAN ID to set its forwarding method. Forwarding Method for IPv6 Set one of the following forwarding methods for IPv6 addresses: MAC Group Address\u2014Forward packets according to the MAC Multicast group address IP Group Address\u2014Forward packets according to the IPv6 Multicast group address Source-Specific IP Group Address\u2014Forward packets according to the source IPv6 and IPv6 Multicast group address. If an IPv6 address is configured on the VLAN, the operational forwarding methods for IPv6 Multicast are IP Group Address. Note For IPv6 IP Group and Source-Specific IP Group Address modes, the device checks a match only for 4 bytes of the destination Multicast and source address. For the destination Multicast address, the last 4 bytes of group ID are matched. For the source address, the last 3 bytes + the 5th from the last byte are matched. Forwarding Method for IPv4 Set one of the following forwarding methods for IPv4 addresses: MAC Group Address\u2014Forward packets according to the MAC Multicast group address IP Group Address\u2014Forward packets according to the IPv4 Multicast group address Source-Specific IP Group Address\u2014Forward packets according to the source IPv4 and IPv4 Multicast group address.

    "page_content": "IPv4 Multicast Configuration A multicast address is a single IP data packet set that represents a network host group. Multicast addresses are available to process datagrams or frames intended to be multicast to a designated network service. Multicast addressing is applied in the link layer (Layer 2 of the OSI Model) and the Internet layer (Layer 3 of the OSI Model) for IP versions 4 (IPv4) and 6 (IPv6). Multicast addresses in IPV4 are defined using leading address bits of 1110, which originate from the classful network design of the early Internet when this group of addresses was designated as Class D. IPv4 multicast packets are delivered using the Ethernet MAC address range 01:00:5e:00:00:00\u201301:00:5e:7f:ff:ff. This range has 23 bits of available address space. The first octet (01) includes the broadcast/multicast bit. The lower 23 bits of the 28-bit multicast IP address are mapped into the 23 bits of available Ethernet address space. This means that there is ambiguity in delivering packets. If two hosts on the same subnet each subscribe to a different multicast group whose address differs only in the first 5 bits, Ethernet packets for both multicast groups will be delivered to both hosts, requiring the network software in the hosts to discard the unrequired packets. This section covers how to configure the IPv4 multicast. IGMP Snooping IGMP VLAN Settings IGMP Snooping To support selective IPv4 Multicast forwarding, bridge Multicast filtering must be enabled (in Multicast Properties). The IGMP Snooping must be enabled globally and for each relevant VLAN in the IGMP Snooping page. To enable IGMP Snooping and identify the device as an IGMP Snooping Querier on a VLAN, follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Multicast > IPv4 Multicast Configuration > IGMP Snooping. IGMP Snooping Status\u2014Select to enable IGMP snooping globally on all interfaces. IGMP Querier Status\u2014Select to enable IGMP querier globally on all interfaces. Step 2 IGMP Snooping is only operational when Bridge Multicast Filtering is enabled. You can enable it here: Multicast Properties. Step 3 To configure IGMP on an interface, select a static VLAN and click Edit. Enter the following fields: Option Description VLAN ID Select The VLAN Id from the dropdown list. IGMP Snooping Status Select to enable IGMP Snooping on the VLAN. The device monitors network traffic to determine which hosts have asked to be sent Multicast traffic. MRouter Ports Auto Learn Select to enable Auto Learn of the Multicast router. Immediate Leave Select to enable the switch to remove an interface that sends a leave message from the forwarding table without first sending out MAC-based general queries to the interface. When an IGMP Leave Group message is received from a host, the system removes the host port from the table entry. After it relays the IGMP queries from the Multicast router, it deletes entries periodically if it doesn\u2019t receive any IGMP membership reports from the Multicast clients. When enabled, this feature reduces the time it takes to block unnecessary IGMP traffic sent to a device port. Last Member Query Counter Number of MLD group-specific queries sent before the device assumes that there are no more members for the group, if the device is the elected querier. Use Query Robustness (x)\u2014The number in parentheses is the current query robustness value. User Defined\u2014Enter a user-defined value. IGMP Querier Status Select to enable this feature. This feature is required if there\u2019s no Multicast router. IGMP Querier Election IGMP Querier Election\u2014Whether the IGMP querier election is enabled or disabled. If the IGMP Querier election mechanism is enabled, the IGMP Snooping querier supports the standard IGMP Querier election mechanism specified in RFC3810. If the IGMP Querier election mechanism is disabled, the IGMP Snooping querier delays sending General Query messages for 60 seconds after it was enabled, and if there\u2019s no other querier, it starts sending General Query messages. It stops sending General Query messages when it detects another querier. The IGMP Snooping Querier resumes sending General Query messages if it does hear another querier for a Query Passive interval that equals: Robustness * (Query Interval) + 0.5 * Query Response Interval. IGMP Querier Version Select the IGMP version to be used if the device becomes the elected querier. Select IGMPv3 if there are switches and/or Multicast routers in the VLAN that perform source-specific IP Multicast forwarding. Otherwise, select IGMPv2. Querier Source IP Address The IP address of the device source interface to be used in messages sent. In MLD this address is selected automatically by the system. Auto\u2014The system takes the source IP address from the IP address defined on the outgoing interface. User Defined\u2014Enter a user-defined IP address. Step 4 Click Apply. The Running Configuration file is updated. Note Changes in IGMP Snooping timers configuration, such as: Query Robustness, Query Interval etc. don\u2019t take effect on timers which already created. IGMP VLAN Settings To configure IGMP on a specific VLAN, complete the following steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Multicast > IPv4 Multicast Configuration > IGMP VLAN Settings. The following fields are displayed for each VLAN on which IGMP is enabled: Interface Name\u2014VLAN on which IGMP snooping is defined. Query Robustness\u2014Enter the number of expected packet losses on a link. Query Interval (sec)\u2014Interval between the General Queries to be used if this device is the elected querier. Query Max Response Interval (sec)\u2014Delay used to calculate the Maximum Response Code inserted into the periodic General Queries. Last Member Query Interval (msec)\u2014Enter the Maximum Response Delay to be used if the device can\u2019t read Max Response Time value from group-specific queries sent by the elected querier. Step 2 Select an interface, and click Edit. Enter the values of the fields described above. Step 3 Click Apply. The Running Configuration file is updated.",

    "page_content": "IPv6 Multicast Configuration IP multicast is a method of sending Internet Protocol (IP) datagrams to a group of interested receivers in a single transmission. It is the IP-specific form of multicast and is used for streaming media and other network applications. It uses specially reserved multicast address blocks in IPv4 and IPv6. Unicast packets are delivered to a specific recipient on an Ethernet or IEEE 802.3 subnet by setting a specific layer 2 MAC address on the Ethernet packet address. Broadcast packets make use of a broadcast MAC address (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF). For IPv6 multicast addresses, the Ethernet MAC is derived by the four low-order octets OR'ed with the MAC 33:33:00:00:00:00, so for example the IPv6 address FF02:DEAD:BEEF:1:3 would map to the Ethernet MAC address 33:33:00:01:00:03.

This section provides information for defining the device IPv4 addresses, either manually or by making the device a DHCP client. The IPv4 Interface page is used to configure IP addresses for device management. This IP address can be configured on a port, a LAG, VLAN, loopback interface or out-of-band interface. You can configure multiple IP addresses (interfaces) on the device. It then supports traffic routing between these various interfaces and also to remote networks. By default and typically, the routing functionality is performed by the hardware. If hardware resources are exhausted or there\u2019s a routing table overflow in the hardware, IP routing is performed by the software. Note The device software consumes one VLAN ID (VID) for every IP address configured on a port or LAG. The device takes the first VID that isn\u2019t used starting from 4094.

Static IP Address\u2014Enter the IP address, and enter the Mask field: Network Mask\u2014IP mask for this address Prefix Length\u2014Length of the IPv4 prefix *Renew IP Address Now\u2014Check Enable to enable. *Auto Configuration via DHCP\u2014 Display the status (Disabled or Enabled). Note *These only appear in the Edit pop-up option. Step 6 Click Apply. The IPv4 address settings are written to the Running Configuration file. Caution When the system is in one of the stacking modes with a standby active unit present, Cisco recommends configuring the IP address as a static address to prevent disconnecting from the network during a active stacking unit switchover. This is because when the standby active unit takes control of the stack, when using DHCP, it might receive a different IP address than the one that was received by the stack\u2019s original active-enabled unit. Configure the Out-of-Band Interface Configure the Out-of-Band Interface Out-of-band management allows the network operator to establish trust boundaries in accessing the management function to apply it to network resources. This section describes how to configure the IPv4 address on the Out-of-Band (OOB) interface. Procedure Step 1 Log in to the web-based utility of the switch then choose IPv4 Configuration > IPv4 Interface. The IPv4 Interface Table on the IPv4 Interface page contains the following information: Interface \u2014 The Unit or interface for which the IP address is defined. This can also be a loopback interface. IP Address Type \u2014 The available options are: DHCP \u2014 Received from Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. Static \u2014 Entered manually. Static interfaces are non-DHCP interfaces that are created by the user. Default \u2014 The default address that exists on the device by default, before any configurations have been made. IP Address \u2014 Configured IP address for the interface. Mask \u2014 Configured IP address mask. Status \u2014 Results of the IP address duplication check. Tentative \u2014 There is no final result for the IP address duplication check. Valid \u2014 The IP address collision check was completed, and no IP address collision was detected. Valid-Duplicated \u2014 The IP address duplication check was completed, and a duplicate IP address was detected. Duplicated \u2014 A duplicated IP address was detected for the default IP address. Delayed \u2014 The assignment of the IP address is delayed for 60 seconds if DHCP Client is enabled on startup in order to give time to discover DHCP address. Not Received \u2014 Relevant only for DHCP Address. When a DHCP Client starts a discovery process, it assigns a dummy IP address 0.0.0.0 before the real address is obtained. This dummy address has the status of Not Received. Step 2 Click Add to manually assign a static IP address. Step 3 From the Interface area, select Out of Band. Step 4 Select Static IP Address from the IP Address Type area. Step 5 Enter the IP address of the OOB interface in the IP Address field. Step 6 Click a radio button from the Mask area then enter the corresponding subnet mask. The options are: Network Mask \u2014 IP mask for this address. Prefix Length \u2014 Length of the IPv4 prefix. Step 7 Click Apply then click Close. Your session will be automatically closed and connection to the switch will be lost as it will apply the new management IP address on the OOB port. You should now have successfully configured the IPv4 management interface addresses on your switch.",

Relay agents are used to forward requests and replies between clients and servers when they are not on the same physical subnet. Relay agent forwarding is distinct from the normal forwarding of an IP router, where IP datagrams are switched between networks somewhat transparently. By contrast, relay agents receive DHCP messages and then generate a new DHCP message to send on another interface.

    "page_content": "IPv6 Global Configuration The Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a network-layer protocol for packet-switched internet works. IPv6 was designed to replace IPv4, the predominantly deployed Internet protocol. IPv6 introduces greater flexibility in assigning IP addresses, because the address size increases from 32-bit to 128-bit addresses. IPv6 addresses are written as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, for example FE80:0000:0000:0000:0000:9C00:876A:130B. The abbreviated form, in which a group of zeroes can be left out, and replaced with ':', is also acceptable, for example, FE80:9C00:876A:130B. IPv6 interface addresses can be configured manually by the user, or automatically configured by a DHCP server. This section provides information for defining the device IPv6 addresses, either manually or by making the device a DHCP client. To define IPv6 global parameters and DHCPv6 client settings, follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click IPv6 Configuration > IPv6 Global Configuration. Step 2 Enter values for the following fields: IPv6 Routing\u2014Select Enable to enable IPv6 routing. If this isn\u2019t enabled, the device acts as a host (not a router) and can receive management packets, but can\u2019t forward packets. If routing is enabled, the device can forward the IPv6 packets. Enabling IPv6 routing removes any address previously assigned to the device interface, via the auto-config operation, from an RA sent by a Router in the network. ICMPv6 Rate Limit Interval\u2014Enter how often the ICMP error messages are generated. ICMPv6 Rate Limit Bucket Size\u2014Enter the maximum number of ICMP error messages that can be sent by the device per interval. IPv6 Hop Limit\u2014Enter the maximum number of intermediate routers on its way to the final destination to which a packet can pass. Each time a packet is forwarded to another router, the hop limit is reduced. When the hop limit becomes zero, the packet is discarded. This prevents packets from being transferred endlessly. DHCPv6 Client Settings Unique Identifier (DUID) Format\u2014This is the identifier of the DHCP client that is used by the DHCP server to locate the client. It can be in one of the following formats: Link-Layer\u2014(Default). If you select this option, the MAC address of the device is used. Enterprise Number\u2014If you select this option, enter the following fields. Enterprise Number\u2014The vendors registered Private Enterprise number as maintained by IANA. Identifier\u2014The vendor-defined hex string (up to 64 hex characters) If the number of the character isn\u2019t even, a zero is added at the right. Each 2 hex characters can be separated by a period or colon. DHCPv6 Unique Identifier (DUID)\u2014Displays the identifier selected. Step 3 Click Apply. The IPv6 global parameters and DHCPv6 client settings are updated.",

    "page_content": "IPv6 Interfaces The Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a network-layer protocol used for packet-switched internet communications.IPv6 was created to replace IPv4, the most widely used Internet protocol. Because the address size increases from 32-bit to 128-bit, IPv6 allows for greater flexibility in assigning IP addresses. IPv6 addresses are composed of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, such as FE80:0000:0000:0000:0000:9C00:876A:130B. To communicate with other IPv6 nodes over an IPv4-only network, IPv6 nodes require an intermediary mapping mechanism. This mechanism, known as a tunnel, allows IPv6-only hosts to access IPv4 services and isolated IPv6 hosts and networks to connect to an IPv6 node via the IPv4 infrastructure. An IPv6 interface can be configured on a port, LAG, VLAN, loopback interface or tunnel. To define an IPv6 interface, follow these steps: Note Tunnel interfaces are created in the IPv6 Tunnels To define an IPv6 interface, follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click IPv6 Configuration > IPv6 Interfaces. Step 2 Enter the parameters. IPv6 Link Local Default Zone\u2014Select Enable to enable defining a default zone. This is an interface to be used to egress a link-local packet arriving without a specified interface or with its default zone 0. IPv6 Link Local Default Zone Interface\u2014Select an interface to be used as a default zone. This can be a previously defined tunnel or other interface. Step 3 Click Apply to configure the default zone. The IPV6 Interface Table is displayed along with the following fields: Tunnel Type\u2014N/A, Manual, 6-4 and ISATAP. Step 4 Click Add to add a new interface on which interface IPv6 is enabled. Step 5 Enter the fields: IPv6 Interface\u2014Select a specific port, LAG, loopback interface or VLAN for the IPv6 address. Step 6 To configure the interface as a DHCPv6 client, meaning to enable the interface to receive information from the DHCPv6 server, such as: SNTP configuration and DNS information, enter the DHCPv6 Client fields: DHCPv6 Client\u2014Select Enable to enable DHCPv6 Client (stateless and stateful) on the interface. Rapid Commit\u2014Select Enable to enable the use of the two-message exchange for address allocation and other configuration. If it\u2019s enabled, the client includes the rapid-commit option in a solicit message. Minimum Information Refresh Time\u2014This value is used to put a floor on the refresh time value. If the server sends a refresh time option that is less than this value, this value is used instead. Select Infinite or User Defined to set a value. Information Refresh Time\u2014This value indicates how often the device refreshes information received from the DHCPv6 server. If this option isn\u2019t received from the server, the value entered here is used. Select Infinite or User Defined to set a value. Step 7 To configure additional IPv6 parameters, enter the following fields: IPv6 Address Auto Configuration\u2014Select Enable to enable automatic address configuration from router advertisements sent by neighbors. Number of DAD Attempts\u2014Enter the number of consecutive neighbor solicitation messages that are sent while Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) is performed on the interface\u2019s Unicast IPv6 addresses. DAD verifies the uniqueness of a new Unicast IPv6 address before it\u2019s assigned. New addresses remain in a tentative state during DAD verification. Entering 0 in this field disables duplicate address detection processing on the specified interface. Entering 1 in this field indicates a single transmission without follow-up transmissions. Send ICMPv6 Messages\u2014Enable generating unreachable destination messages. MLD Version\u2014Select the IPv6 MLD version. IPv6 Redirects\u2014Select Enable to enable sending ICMP IPv6 redirect messages. These messages inform other devices not to send traffic to the device, but rather to another device. Step 8 Click Apply to enable IPv6 processing on the selected interface. Regular IPv6 interfaces have the following addresses automatically configured: Link local address using EUI-64 format interface ID based on a device's MAC address All node link local Multicast addresses (FF02:1) Solicited-Node Multicast address (format FF02:1:FFXX:X) Step 9 Click IPv6 Address Table to manually assign IPv6 addresses to the interface, if required. Step 10 To add a tunnel, select an interface in the IPv6 Tunnel Table and click IPv6 Tunnel. Step 11 Click Apply to save the settings. Step 12 Press Restart to initiate refresh of the stateless information received from the DHCPv6 server.",

    "page_content": "IPv6 Tunnels Tunnels enable transmission of IPv6 packets over IPv4 networks. Each tunnel has a source IPv4 address and if it\u2019s a manual tunnel it also has a destination IPv4 address. The IPv6 packet is encapsulated between these addresses. Note The tunneling options will be displayed differently between the 10G SKUs and the non 10G SKUs. ISATAP Tunnels The device supports a single Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) tunnel. An ISATAP tunnel is a point-to-multi-point tunnel. The source address is the IPv4 address (or one of the IPv4 addresses) of the device. When configuring an ISATAP tunnel, the destination IPv4 address is provided by the router. Note that: An IPv6 link local address is assigned to the ISATAP interface. The initial IP address is assigned to the interface, which is then activated. If an ISATAP interface is active, the ISATAP router IPv4 address is resolved via DNS by using ISATAP-to-IPv4 mapping. If the ISATAP DNS record is not resolved, ISATAP host name-to-address mapping is searched in the host mapping table When the ISATAP router IPv4 address is not resolved via the DNS process, the ISATAP IP interface remains active. The system does not have a default router for ISATAP traffic until the DNS process is resolved. Additional Types of Tunnels The following additional types of tunnels can be configured on the device: Manual Tunnel An IPv6 link local address is assigned to the ISATAP interface. The initial IP address is assigned to the interface, which is then activated If an ISATAP interface is active, the ISATAP router IPv4 address is resolved via DNS by using ISATAP-to-IPv4 mapping. If the ISATAP DNS record is not resolved, ISATAP host name-to-address mapping is searched in the host mapping table. When the ISATAP router IPv4 address is not resolved via the DNS process, the ISATAP IP interface remains active. The system does not have a default router for ISATAP traffic until the DNS process is resolved. This is a point-to-point definition. When creating a manual tunnel, you enter both the source IP address (one of the device\u2019s IP addresses) and the destination IPv4 address. 6 to 4 Tunnel 6 to 4 is an automatic tunneling mechanism that uses the underlying IPv4 network as a non-Broadcast multiple-access link layer for IPv6. Only one 6 to 4 tunnel is supported on a device. The 6 to 4 tunnel is supported only when IPv6 Forwarding is supported. IPv6 Multicast is not supported on the 6to4 tunnel interface The switch automatically creates a 2002:/16 on-link prefix on the 6to4 tunnel. The connected 2002:/16 route on the tunnel is added to the Routing Table as result of the on-link prefix creation When the tunnel mode is changed from 6to4 to another mode, the on-link prefix and connected routes are removed. When the next hop outgoing interface is the 6to4 tunnel, the IPv4 address of the next hop node is taken from the prefix 2002:WWXX:YYZZ:/48 of the IPv6 next hop IPv6 address, if it is global, and from the last 32 bits of the interface identifier of the IPv6next hop IPv6 address, if it is link local. The following table summarizes tunnel support in the various devices: Tunnel Type C1200 C1300 C1300 Stacking C1300 Stacking Supporting 10G ISATAP Supported Supported Supported Supported Manual Not Supported Not Supported Not Supported Supported - Up to 16 tunnels Automatic 6to4 tunnel Not Supported Not Supported Not Supported Supported - a single 4-6 tunnel (with up to 16 tunnels in total) To configure an IPv6 tunnel follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click IPv6 Configuration > IPv6 Tunnel. Step 2 Click Create ISATAP Tunnel. Step 3 The Tunnel Number (1) and its Tunnel Type (ISATAP) are displayed. Step 4 Enter the following fields Source IPv4 Address\u2014Set the local (source) IPv4 address of a tunnel interface. The IPv4 address of the selected IPv4 interface is used to form part of the IPv6 address over the ISATAP tunnel interface. The IPv6 address has a 64-bit network prefix of fe80:, with the rest of the 64-bit formed by concatenating 0000:5EFE and the IPv4 address. Auto\u2014Automatically selects the lowest IPv4 address from among all of its configured IPv4 interfaces as the source address for packets sent on the tunnel interface. Manual\u2014Specifies the IPv4 address to use as the source address for packets sent on the tunnel interface. The local address of the tunnel interface is not changed when the IPv4 address is moved to another interface. Note If the device IPv4 address is changed, the local address of the tunnel interface is also changed Interface\u2014Specifies the interface ISATAP Router Name\u2014 Select one of the following options to configure a global string that represents a specific automatic tunnel router domain name. Use Default\u2014This is always ISATAP. User Defined\u2014Enter the router\u2019s domain name. Step 5 Enter the parameters: ISATAP Solicitation Interval\u2014The number of seconds between ISATAP router solicitations messages, when no active ISATAP router is discovered. The interval can be the Default Value or a User Defined interval. ISATAP Robustness\u2014Used to calculate the interval for router solicitation queries. The bigger the number, the more frequent the queries. The interval can be the Default Value or a User Defined interval. Note The ISATAP tunnel is not operational if the underlying IPv4 interface is not in operation. Step 6 To delete an ISATAP tunnel, click Delete ISATAP Tunnel.

It covers the following topics: Router Advertisement IPv6 Prefixes Router Advertisement A router advertisement packet contains various configurations for IPv6 hosts including the network part of the layer 3 IPv6 address required by hosts to communicate in the internet. Clients then generate the universally unique host part of the address and derive the complete address. This feature can be enabled or suppressed per interface, as follows: Procedure Step 1 Click IPv6 Configuration > IPv6 Router Configuration > Router Advertisement. Step 2 To configure an interface listed in the Router Advertisement Table, select it and click Edit. Step 3 Enter the following fields: Option Description Interface Select the interface from the drop down list. Suppress Router Advertisement Select Yes to suppress IPv6 router advertisement transmissions on the interface. Router Preference Select either Low, Medium or High preference for the router. Router advertisement messages are sent with the preference configured in this field. If no preference is configured, they are sent with a medium preference. Include Advertisement Interval Option Select to indicate that an advertisement option will be used by the system. This option indicates to a visiting mobile node the interval at which that node may expect to receive router advertisements. The node may use this information in its movement detection algorithm. Hop Limit This is the value that the router advertises. If it\u2019s not zero, it\u2019s used as the hop limit by the host. Managed Address Configuration Flag Select this flag to indicate to attached hosts that they should use stateful auto configuration to obtain addresses. Hosts may use stateful and stateless address auto configuration simultaneously. Other Stateful Configuration Flag Other Stateful Configuration Flag\u2014Select this flag to indicate to attached hosts that they should use stateful auto configuration to obtain other (non-address) information. Note If the Managed Address Configuration flag is set, an attached host can use stateful auto configuration to obtain the other (non-address) information regardless of the setting of this flag. Neighbor Solicitation Retransmissions Interval Enter the interval to determine the time between retransmissions of neighbor solicitation messages to a neighbor when resolving the address or when probing the reachability of a neighbor (User Defined), or select Use Default to use the system default (1000). Maximum Router Advertisement Interval Enter the maximum amount of time that can pass between router advertisements. The interval between transmissions should be less than or equal to the IPv6 router advertisement lifetime if you configure the route as a default router by using this command. To prevent synchronization with other IPv6 nodes, the actual interval used is randomly selected from a value between the minimum and maximum values. Minimum Router Advertisement Interval Enter the minimum amount of time that can pass between router advertisements (User Defined) or select Use Default to user the system default. Note The minimum RA interval may never be more than 75% of the maximum RA interval and never less than 3 seconds. Router Advertisement Lifetime Enter the remaining length of time, in seconds, that this router remains useful as a default router. A value of zero indicates that it\u2019s no longer useful as a default router. Reachable Time Enter the amount of time that a remote IPv6 node is considered reachable (in milliseconds) (User Defined) or select the Use Default option to use the system default.

The IPv6 Neighbor Table (also known as IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Cache) displays the MAC addresses of the IPv6 neighbors that are in the same IPv6 subnet as the device. This is the IPv6 equivalent of the IPv4 ARP Table. When the device needs to communicate with its neighbors, the device uses the IPv6 Neighbor Table to determine the MAC addresses based on their IPv6 addresses. This page displays the neighbors that automatically detected or manually configured entries. Each entry displays to which interface the neighbor is connected, the neighbor\u2019s IPv6 and MAC addresses, the entry type (static or dynamic), and the state of the neighbor. To define IPv6 neighbors, complete the following steps: Procedure Step 1 Click IPv6 Configuration > IPv6 Neighbors. You can select an option to clear some or all of the IPv6 addresses in the Clear Table section. Static Only\u2014Deletes the static IPv6 address entries. Dynamic Only\u2014Deletes the dynamic IPv6 address entries. All Dynamic & Static\u2014Deletes the static and dynamic address entries IPv6 address entries.

    "page_content": "Host Mapping Host name/IP address mappings are stored in the Host Mapping Table (DNS cache). This cache can contain the following type of entries: Static Entries\u2014These are mapping pairs that manually added to the cache. There can be up to 64 static entries. Dynamic Entries\u2014Are mapping pairs that are either added by the system as a result of being used by the user, or an entry for each IP address configured on the device by DHCP. There can be 256 dynamic entries. Name resolution always begins by checking static entries, continues by checking the dynamic entries, and ends by sending requests to the external DNS server. Eight IP addresses are supported per DNS server per host name. To add a host name and its IP address, complete the following: Procedure Step 1 Click General IP Configuration > DNS > Host Mapping. Step 2 If required, select one of the following options from Clear Table to clear some or all of the entries in the Host Mapping Table. Static Only\u2014Deletes the static hosts.

    "page_content": "Management Access Method This section describes access rules for various management methods. Access profiles determine how to authenticate and authorize users accessing the device through various access methods. Access Profiles can limit management access from specific sources. Only users who pass both the active access profile and the management access authentication methods are given management access to the device. There can only be a single access profile active on the device at one time. Access profiles consist of one or more rules. The rules are executed in order of their priority within the access profile (top to bottom). Rules are composed of filters that include the following elements: Access Methods-Methods for accessing and managing the device: Telnet Secure Telnet (SSH) Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Secure HTTP (HTTPS) Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) All of the above Action-Permit or deny access to an interface or source address. Interface-Which ports, LAGs, or VLANs are permitted to access or are denied access to the web-based configuration utility. Source IP Address-IP addresses or subnets. Access to management methods might differ among user groups. For example, one user group might be able to access the device module only by using an HTTPS session, while another user group might be able to access the device module by using both HTTPS and Telnet sessions. Access Profiles Profile Rules Access Profiles The Access Profiles page displays the access profiles that are defined and enables selecting one access profile to be the active one. When a user attempts to access the device through an access method, the device looks to see if the active access profile explicitly permits management access to the device through this method. If no match is found, access is denied. When an attempt to access the device is in violation of the active access profile, the device generates a SYSLOG message to alert the system administrator of the attempt. If a console-only access profile has been activated, the only way to deactivate it\u2019s through a direct connection from the management station to the physical console port on the device. For more information, see Profile Rules. Use the Access Profiles page to create an access profile and to add its first rule. If the access profile only contains a single rule, you\u2019re finished. To add more rules to the profile, use the Profile Rules page. Procedure Step 1 Click Security > Mgmt Access Method > Access Profiles. Step 2 To change the active access profile, select a profile from the Active Access Profile drop down menu and click Apply. Step 3 A pop-up will appear asking you to confirm the Active Access Profile change. Click OK to confirm or click Cancel to cancel. Step 4 Click Add to open the Add Access Profile page. The page allows you to configure a new profile and one rule. Step 5 Enter the Access Profile Name. This name can contain up to 32 characters. Step 6 Enter the parameters. Rule Priority\u2014Enter the rule priority. When the packet is matched to a rule, user groups are either granted or denied access to the device. The rule priority is essential to matching packets to rules, as packets are matched on a first-match basis. The highest priority is \u20181\u2019. Management Method\u2014Select the management method for which the rule is defined. The options are: All\u2014Assigns all management methods to the rule Telnet\u2014Users requesting access to the device that meets the Telnet access profile criteria are permitted or denied access. Secure Telnet (SSH)\u2014Users requesting access to the device that meets the SSH access profile criteria, are permitted or denied access. HTTP\u2014 Users requesting access to the device that meets the HTTP access profile criteria, are permitted or denied. Secure HTTP (HTTPS)\u2014Users requesting access to the device that meets the HTTPS access profile criteria, are permitted or denied. SNMP\u2014Users requesting access to the device that meets the SNMP access profile criteria are permitted or denied. Action\u2014Select the action attached to the rule. The options are: Permit\u2014Permits access to the device if the user matches the settings in the profile. Deny\u2014Denies access to the device if the user matches the settings in the profile Applies to Interface\u2014Select the interface attached to the rule. The options are: All\u2014Applies to all ports, VLANs, and LAGs User Defined\u2014Applies to selected interface. Interface\u2014Enter the interface number if User Defined was selected. Applies to Source IP Address\u2014Select the type of source IP address to which the access profile applies. The Source IP Address field is valid for a subnetwork. Select one of the following values: All\u2014Applies to all types of IP addresses User Defined\u2014Applies to only those types of IP addresses defined in the fields. IP Version\u2014Enter the version of the source IP address: Version 6 or Version 4. IP Address\u2014Enter the source IP address. Mask\u2014Select the format for the subnet mask for the source IP address, and enter a value in one of the fields: Network Mask\u2014Select the subnet to which the source IP address belongs and enter the subnet mask in dotted decimal format. Prefix Length\u2014Select the Prefix Length and enter the number of bits that comprise the source IP address prefix. Step 7 Click Apply. The access profile is written to the Running Configuration file. You can now select this access profile as the active access profile. Profile Rules Access profiles can contain up to 128 rules to determine who is permitted to manage and access the device, and the access methods that may be used. Each rule in an access profile contains an action and criteria (one or more parameters) to match. Each rule has a priority; rules with the lowest priority are checked first. If the incoming packet matches a rule, the action associated with the rule is performed. If no matching rule is found within the active access profile, the packet is dropped. For example, you can limit access to the device from all IP addresses except IP addresses that are allocated to the IT management center. In this way, the device can still be managed and has gained another layer of security. To add profile rules to an access profile, complete the following steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Security > Mgmt Access Method > Profile Rules. Step 2 Select the Filter field, and an access profile.

    "page_content": "Management Access Authentication You can assign authentication methods to the various management access methods, such as SSH, Telnet, HTTP, and HTTPS. The authentication can be performed locally or on a server. If authorization is enabled, both the identity and read/write privileges of the user are verified. If authorization isn\u2019t enabled, only the identity of the user is verified. The authorization/authentication method used is determined by the order that the authentication methods are selected. If the first authentication method isn\u2019t available, the next selected method is used. For example, if the selected authentication methods are RADIUS and Local, and all configured RADIUS servers are queried in priority order and don\u2019t reply, the user is authorized/authenticated locally. If authorization is enabled, and an authentication method fails or the user has insufficient privilege level, the user is denied access to the device. In other words, if authentication fails for an authentication method, the device stops the authentication attempt; it doesn\u2019t continue and doesn\u2019t attempt to use the next authentication method. Similarly, if authorization isn\u2019t enabled, and authentication fails for a method, the device stops the authentication attempt.

In addition, SSD enables the secure backup and sharing of configuration files containing sensitive data. SSD provides users with the flexibility to configure the desired level of protection on their sensitive data; from no protection with sensitive data in plaintext, minimum protection with encryption based on the default passphrase, and better protection with encryption based on user-defined passphrase. SSD grants read permission to sensitive data only to authenticated and authorized users, and according to SSD rules. A device authenticates and authorizes management access to users through the user authentication process. Whether or not SSD is used, it is recommended that the administrator secure the authentication process by using the local authentication database, and/or secure the communication to the external authentication servers used in the user authentication process. In summary, SSD protects sensitive data on a device with SSD rules, SSD properties, and user authentication. And SSD rules, SSD properties, and user authentication configurations of the device are themselves sensitive data protected by SSD. SSD Properties SSD Rules SSD Properties SSD properties are a set of parameters that, in conjunction with the SSD rules, define and control the SSD environment of a device.

    "page_content": "SSL Server The Secure Socket Layer (SSL) feature is used to open an HTTPS session to the device. An HTTPS session may be opened with the default certificate that exists on the device. Some browsers generate warnings when using a default certificate, since this certificate is not signed by a Certification Authority (CA). It is best practice to have a certificate signed by a trusted CA. By default, the device contains certificates that can be modified. HTTPS is enabled by default. SSL Server Authentication Settings SSL Server Authentication Settings Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) authentication is a protocol for creating a secure connection for user-server interactions. A server and a user are involved in every web interaction. Users frequently enter sensitive, personal information on websites, putting persons and systems at risk. Better authentication strengthens security, especially for sites that store financial, medical, or personal data. Stable, verifiable, and secure user interactions are required. The way that a server verifies that the user is a real person is by collecting information. There are a number of ways this can be done. Procedure Step 1 Click Security > SSL Server > SSL Server Authentication Settings. Information appears for certificate 1 and 2 in the SSL Server Key Table. These fields are defined in the Edit page except for the following fields: Valid From\u2014Specifies the date from which the certificate is valid. Valid To\u2014Specifies the date up to which the certificate is valid. Certificate Source\u2014Specifies whether the certificate was generated by the system (Auto Generated) or the user (User Defined). Step 2 The device includes 2 certificates. Only one of them is the active certificate which can be used for the HTTPS session. To define which certificate is active, in the SSL Active Certificate Number, select an active certificate (1 or 2). Step 3 Click Apply. Step 4 In the HTTPS Session Logging section, check Enable to enable. By enabling the HTTPS session logging, this will allow a user to track the progress of HTTPS session setup and tear-down, via syslog messages generated by the device. Step 5 Click Apply.

    "page_content": "SSL Server Authentication Settings Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) authentication is a protocol for creating a secure connection for user-server interactions. A server and a user are involved in every web interaction. Users frequently enter sensitive, personal information on websites, putting persons and systems at risk. Better authentication strengthens security, especially for sites that store financial, medical, or personal data. Stable, verifiable, and secure user interactions are required. The way that a server verifies that the user is a real person is by collecting information. There are a number of ways this can be done. Procedure Step 1 Click Security > SSL Server > SSL Server Authentication Settings. Information appears for certificate 1 and 2 in the SSL Server Key Table. These fields are defined in the Edit page except for the following fields: Valid From\u2014Specifies the date from which the certificate is valid.

    "page_content": "Port Security Note Port security cannot be enabled on ports on which 802.1X is enabled or on ports that defined as SPAN destination. Network security can be increased by limiting access on a port to users with specific MAC addresses. The MAC addresses can be either dynamically learned or statically configured. Port security monitors received and learned packets. Access to locked ports is limited to users with specific MAC addresses. Port Security has four modes: Classic Lock\u2014All learned MAC addresses on the port are locked, and the port doesn\u2019t learn any new MAC addresses. The learned addresses aren\u2019t subject to aging or relearning. Limited Dynamic Lock\u2014The device learns MAC addresses up to the configured limit of allowed addresses. After the limit is reached, the device doesn\u2019t learn additional addresses. In this mode, the addresses are subject to aging and relearning. Secure Permanent\u2014Keeps the current dynamic MAC addresses associated with the port (as long as the configuration was saved to the Start configuration file). New MAC addresses can be learned as Permanent Secure ones up to the maximum addresses allowed on the port. Relearning and aging are disabled. Secure Delete on Reset\u2014Deletes the current dynamic MAC addresses associated with the port after reset. New MAC addresses can be learned as Delete-On-Reset ones up to the maximum addresses allowed on the port. Relearning and aging are disabled. When a frame from a new MAC address is detected on a port where it\u2019s not authorized (the port is classically locked, and there\u2019s a new MAC address, or the port is dynamically locked, and the maximum number of allowed addresses has been exceeded), the protection mechanism is invoked, and one of the following actions can take place: Frame is discarded. Frame is forwarded. Port is shut down. When the secure MAC address is seen on another port, the frame is forwarded, but the MAC address isn\u2019t learned on that port. In addition to one of these actions, you can also generate traps, and limit their frequency and number to avoid overloading the devices. To configure port security, complete the following: Procedure Step 1 Click Security > Port Security. Step 2 Select an interface to be modified, and click Edit. Step 3 Enter the parameters. Interface\u2014Select the interface name. Interface Status\u2014Select to lock the port. Learning Mode\u2014Select the type of port locking. To configure this field, the Interface Status must be unlocked. The Learning Mode field is enabled only if the Interface Status field is locked. To change the Learning Mode, the Lock Interface must be cleared. After the mode is changed, the Lock Interface can be reinstated. The options are: Classic Lock\u2014Locks the port immediately, regardless of the number of addresses that have already been learned. Limited Dynamic Lock\u2014Locks the port by deleting the current dynamic MAC addresses associated with the port. The port learns up to the maximum addresses allowed on the port. Both relearning and aging of MAC addresses are enabled. Secure Permanent\u2014Keeps the current dynamic MAC addresses associated with the port and learns up to the maximum number of addresses allowed on the port (set by Max No. of Addresses Allowed). Relearning and aging are disabled. Secure Delete on Reset\u2014Deletes the current dynamic MAC addresses associated with the port after reset. New MAC addresses can be learned as Delete-On-Reset ones up to the maximum addresses allowed on the port. Relearning and aging are disabled. Max No. of Addresses Allowed\u2014Enter the maximum number of MAC addresses that can be learned on the port if Limited Dynamic Lock learning mode is selected. The number 0 indicates that only static addresses are supported on the interface. Action on Violation\u2014Select an action to be applied to packets arriving on a locked port. The options are: Discard\u2014Discards packets from any unlearned source Forward\u2014Forwards packets from an unknown source without learning the MAC address Shutdown\u2014Discards packets from any unlearned source, and shuts down the port The port remains shut down until reactivated, or until the device is rebooted. Trap\u2014Select to enable traps when a packet is received on a locked port. This is relevant for lock violations. For Classic Lock, this is any new address received. For Limited Dynamic Lock, this is any new address that exceeds the number of allowed addresses. Trap Frequency\u2014Enter minimum time (in seconds) that elapses between traps. Step 4 Click Apply.

In this model, network devices have the following specific roles. Client or supplicant Authenticator Authentication server A network device can be either a client/supplicant, authenticator or both per port. Properties Port Authentication Host and Session Authentication Authenticated Hosts Properties The Properties page is used to globally enable port/device authentication. For authentication to function, it must be activated both globally and individually on each port. To define port-based authentication, follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Security > 802.1X Authentication > Properties. Step 2 Enter the parameters. Port-Based Authentication\u2014Enable or disable port-based authentication. Authentication Method\u2014Select the user authentication methods. The options are: RADIUS, None\u2014Perform port authentication first by using the RADIUS server. If no response is received from RADIUS, then no authentication is performed, and the session is permitted. RADIUS\u2014Authenticate the user on the RADIUS server. If no authentication is performed, the session isn\u2019t permitted. None\u2014Don\u2019t authenticate the user. Permit the session. Guest VLAN\u2014Select to enable the use of a guest VLAN for unauthorized ports. If a guest VLAN is enabled, all unauthorized ports automatically join the VLAN selected in the Guest VLAN ID field. If a port is later authorized, it\u2019s removed from the guest VLAN. The guest VLAN can be defined as a layer 3 interface (assigned an IP address) like any other VLAN. However, device management isn\u2019t available via the guest VLAN IP address. Guest VLAN ID\u2014Select the guest VLAN from the list of VLANs. Guest VLAN Timeout\u2014Define a time period as either Immediate or enter a value in User Defined. This value is used as follows: After linkup, if the software doesn\u2019t detect the 802.1X supplicant, or the authentication has failed, the port is added to the guest VLAN, only after the Guest VLAN timeout period has expired. If the port state changes from Authorized to Not Authorized, the port is added to the guest VLAN only after the Guest VLAN timeout has expired. Trap Settings\u2014To enable traps, select one of more of the following options: 802.1x Authentication Failure Traps\u2014Select to generate a trap if 802.1x authentication fails. 802.1x Authentication Success Traps\u2014Select to generate a trap if 802.1x authentication succeeds. Step 3 Click Apply. The 802.1X properties are written to the Running Configuration file. Port Authentication The Port Authentication page enables configuration of parameters for each port. Since some of the configuration changes are only possible while the port is in Force Authorized state, such as host authentication, it\u2019s recommended that you change the port control to Force Authorized before making changes. When the configuration is complete, return the port control to its previous state. Note A port with 802.1x defined on it can\u2019t become a member of a LAG. 802.1x and Port Security can\u2019t be enabled on same port at same time. If you enable port security on an interface, the Administrative Port Control can\u2019t be changed to Auto mode. To define 802.1X authentication: Procedure Step 1 Click Security > 802.1X Authentication > Port Authentication. Step 2 Select a port and click Edit. Step 3 Enter the parameters. Interface\u2014Select a port. Current Port Control\u2014Displays the current port authorization state. If the state is Authorized, the port is either authenticated or the Administrative Port Control is Force Authorized. Conversely, if the state is Unauthorized, then the port is either not authenticated or the Administrative Port Control is Force Unauthorized. If supplicant is enabled on an interface, the current port control is Supplicant. Administrative Port Control\u2014Select the Administrative Port Authorization state. The options are: Force Unauthorized\u2014Denies the interface access by moving the interface into the unauthorized state. The device doesn\u2019t provide authentication services to the client through the interface. Auto\u2014Enables port-based authentication and authorization on the device. The interface moves between an authorized or unauthorized state based on the authentication exchange between the device and the client. Force Authorized\u2014Authorizes the interface without authentication. Guest VLAN\u2014Select to enable using a guest VLAN for unauthorized ports. Periodic Reauthentication\u2014Select to enable port reauthentication attempts after the specified Reauthentication Period. Reauthentication Period\u2014Enter the number of seconds after which the selected port is reauthenticated. Reauthenticate Now\u2014Select to enable immediate port reauthentication.

    "page_content": "Denial of Service Prevention A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is a hacker attempt to make a device unavailable to its users. DoS attacks saturate the device with external communication requests, so that it cannot respond to legitimate traffic. These attacks usually lead to a device CPU overload. One method of resisting DoS attacks employed by the device is the use of Secure Core Technology (SCT), which is enabled by default and cannot be disabled. The Cisco device is an advanced device that handles management traffic, protocol traffic and snooping traffic, in addition to end-user (TCP) traffic. SCT ensures that the device receives and processes management and protocol traffic, no matter how much total traffic is received. This is done by rate-limiting TCP traffic to the CPU. Security Suite Settings SYN Protection Martian Addresses SYN Filtering SYN Rate Protection ICMP Filtering IP Fragments Filtering Security Suite Settings Note Before activating DoS Prevention, you must unbind all Access Control Lists (ACLs) or advanced QoS policies that are bound to a port. ACL and advanced QoS policies aren\u2019t active when a port has DoS Protection enabled on it. To configure DoS Prevention global settings and monitor SCT: Procedure Step 1 Click Security > Denial of Service Prevention > Security Suite Settings. CPU Protection Mechanism: Enabled indicates that SCT is enabled. Step 2 Click Details beside CPU Utilization to go to the CPU Utilization page and view CPU resource utilization information. Step 3 Click Edit beside TCP SYN Protection to set the feature. Step 4 Configure the DoS Prevention settings: Disable-Disable all types of Denial of Service features (except device level TCP SYN protection). System-Level Prevention-Enable preventing attacks from Stacheldraht Distribution, Invasor Trojan, Back Orifice Trojan and Martian Addresses. System-Level and Interface-Level Prevention-In addition to the system-level prevention, you can enable and configure the following interface-level settings: Syn Filtering, Syn Rate Protection, ICMP Filtering and IP Fragmented. Step 5 If System-Level Prevention or System-Level and Interface-Level Prevention is selected, enable one or more of the following Denial of Service Protection options: Stacheldraht Distribution-Discards TCP packets with source TCP port equal to 16660. Invasor Trojan-Discards TCP packets with destination TCP port equal to 2140 and source TCP port equal to 1024. Back Orifice Trojan-Discards UDP packets with destination UDP port equal to 31337 and source UDP port equal to 1024. Step 6 Click the following as required: Martian Addresses-Click Edit to go to the Martian Addresses page. SYN Filtering-Click Edit to go to the SYN Filtering page. SYN Rate Protection-(In Layer 2 only) Click Edit to go to the SYN Rate Protection page. ICMP Filtering-Click Edit to go to the ICMP Filtering page. IP Fragmented-Click Edit to go to the IP Fragments Filtering page. Step 7 Click Apply. The Denial of Service prevention Security Suite settings are written to the Running Configuration file. SYN Protection The network ports might be used by hackers to attack the device in a SYN attack, which consumes TCP resources (buffers) and CPU power. Since the CPU is protected using SCT, TCP traffic to the CPU is limited. However, if one or more ports are attacked with a high rate of SYN packets, the CPU receives only the attacker packets, thus creating Denial-of-Service. When using the SYN protection feature, the CPU counts the SYN packets ingressing from each network port to the CPU per second. To configure SYN protection, follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Security > Denial of Service Prevention > SYN Protection. Step 2 Enter the parameters. Block SYN-FIN Packets-Select to enable the feature. All TCP packets with both SYN and FIN flags are dropped on all ports. SYN Protection Mode-Select between three modes: Disable-The feature is disabled on a specific interface. Report-Generates a SYSLOG message. The status of the port is changed to Attacked when the threshold is passed Block and Report-When a TCP SYN attack is identified, TCP SYN packets destined for the system are dropped and the status of the port is changed to Blocked. SYN Protection Threshold-Number of SYN packets per second before SYN packets will be blocked (deny SYN with MAC-to-me rule will be applied on the port). SYN Protection Period-Time in seconds before unblocking the SYN packets (the deny SYN with MAC-to-me rule is unbound from the port). Step 3 Click Apply. SYN protection is defined, and the Running Configuration file is updated. The SYN Protection Interface Table displays the following fields for every port or LAG (as requested by the user). Current Status-Interface status. The possible values are: Normal-No attack was identified on this interface. Blocked-Traffic isn\u2019t forwarded on this interface. Attacked-Attack was identified on this interface. Last Attack-Date of last SYN-FIN attack identified by the system and the system action. Martian Addresses The Martian Addresses page enables entering IP addresses that indicate an attack if they are seen on the network. Packets from these addresses are discarded. The device supports a set of reserved Martian addresses that are illegal from the point of view of the IP protocol. The supported reserved Martian addresses are: Addresses defined to be illegal in the Martian Addresses page Addresses that are illegal from the point of view of the protocol, such as loopback addresses, including addresses within the following ranges: 0.0.0.0/8 (Except 0.0.0.0/32 as a Source Address)-Addresses in this block refer to source hosts on this network. 127.0.0.0/8-Used as the Internet host loopback address 192.0.2.0/24-Used as the TEST-NET in documentation and example codes 224.0.0.0/4 (As a Source IP Address)-Used in IPv4 Multicast address assignments, and was formerly known as Class D Address Space. 240.0.0.0/4 (Except 255.255.255.255/32 as a Destination Address)-Reserved address range, and was formerly known as Class E Address Space. You can also add new Martian Addresses for DoS prevention. Packets that have a Martian address are discarded. To define Martian addresses, follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Security > Denial of Service Prevention > Martian Addresses. Step 2 Select Reserved Martian Addresses and click Apply to include the reserved Martian Addresses in the System Level Prevention list. Step 3 To add a Martian address click Add. Step 4 Enter the parameters. IP Version-Indicates the supported IP version. Currently, support is only offered for IPv4. IP Address-Enter an IP address to reject. The possible values are: From Reserved List-Select a well-known IP address from the reserved list. New IP Address-Enter an IP address. Mask-Enter the mask of the IP address to define a range of IP addresses to reject. The values are: Network Mask-Network mask in dotted decimal format Prefix Length-Enter the prefix of the IP address to define the range of IP addresses for which Denial of Service prevention is enabled. Step 5 Click Apply. SYN Filtering The SYN Filtering page enables filtering TCP packets that contain a SYN flag, and are destined for one or more ports. To define a SYN filter, complete the following steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Security > Denial of Service Prevention > SYN Filtering. Step 2 Click Add. Step 3 Enter the parameters. Interface\u2014Select the interface on which the filter is defined. IPv4 Address\u2014Enter the IP address for which the filter is defined, or select All addresses.

To configure SYN protection, follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Security > Denial of Service Prevention > SYN Protection. Step 2 Enter the parameters. Block SYN-FIN Packets-Select to enable the feature. All TCP packets with both SYN and FIN flags are dropped on all ports. SYN Protection Mode-Select between three modes: Disable-The feature is disabled on a specific interface. Report-Generates a SYSLOG message. The status of the port is changed to Attacked when the threshold is passed Block and Report-When a TCP SYN attack is identified, TCP SYN packets destined for the system are dropped and the status of the port is changed to Blocked. SYN Protection Threshold-Number of SYN packets per second before SYN packets will be blocked (deny SYN with MAC-to-me rule will be applied on the port). SYN Protection Period-Time in seconds before unblocking the SYN packets (the deny SYN with MAC-to-me rule is unbound from the port). Step 3 Click Apply. SYN protection is defined, and the Running Configuration file is updated. The SYN Protection Interface Table displays the following fields for every port or LAG (as requested by the user). Current Status-Interface status. The possible values are: Normal-No attack was identified on this interface. Blocked-Traffic isn\u2019t forwarded on this interface. Attacked-Attack was identified on this interface. Last Attack-Date of last SYN-FIN attack identified by the system and the system action.",

    "page_content": "Certificate Settings The Cisco Business Dashboard Probe (CBD) and Plug-n-Play (PNP) features require CA certificates to establish HTTPS communication with the CBD or PNP servers. The Certificate Settings feature allows these applications and device managers to do the following: Install trusted CA certificates and to remove certificates that are no longer wanted Statically add certificates to device configuration file Manage a revocation list of untrusted certificates In addition, the Certificate Settings feature can be used to import intermediate certificates that create the device HTTPS server certificate chain. For more details, please see SSL Server Authentication Settings. Note The validity of the certificates is based on the system clock. Use the default system clock or it does not provide proper validation. Therefore, make sure the system clock is based on device Real time clock (if supported) or was actively set since the last reboot (preferably via SNTP service). If the system clock is not based on RTC or was not set since last reboot validation of certificate will fail, even if the system clock is within the validity date of the certificate. Dynamic CertificatesThe CBD and PNP applications can install dynamic trusted certificates to the device memory. The installed certificate must include the following attributes: Certificate name \u2014 A string that is used to identify the certificate. Owner\u2014 The application name that installed the certificate (for example, PNP, CBD) The certificate itself in PEM format. An application can also delete a specific or all dynamic certificates installed by that application. Considerations Up to 512 dynamic certificates can be installed on the device. Dynamic certificates are removed when the device reboots Static Certificates If an application wants to add a certificate that will not be deleted on reset, or if a user of the switch wants to add a certificate, they can add a static certificate including an intermediate certificate(s) used to sign the device HTTPS server certificate. These certificates are saved in the device running configuration and can be copied to the startup configuration. Adding a static certificate requires providing the following attributes: Certificate name \u2014This is a string that is used to identify the certificate. Owner\u2014 the name of the application that installed the certificate (for example, PNP, CBD), or \"static\" if certificate is added by a user. The certificate itself in PEM format. Considerations Up to 256 static certificates can be installed on the device. It is possible for identical certificates to be added by different applications or users as long as the names used to identify them are different. CA Certificate Setting CA Certificate Revocation List CA Certificate Setting Users can access information on all installed certificates (dynamic and static).

    "page_content": "General Quality of Service (QoS) is a feature on the switch which prioritizes traffic resulting in a performance improvement for critical network traffic. QoS varies by switch, as the higher the level switch, the higher the network application layer it works with. The number of queues differ, as well as the kind of information used to prioritize. QoS Properties Queues CoS/802.1p to Queue DSCP to Queue Bandwidth Egress Shaping per Queue VLAN Ingress Rate Limit TCP Congestion Avoidance QoS Properties Quality of Service (QoS) prioritizes the traffic flow based on the type of traffic and can be applied to prioritize traffic for latency-sensitive applications (such as voice or video) and to control the impact of latency-insensitive traffic. To configure QoS properties, follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Quality of Service > General > QoS Properties. Step 2 Set the QoS mode. The following options are available: Disable\u2014QoS is disabled on the device. Basic\u2014QoS is enabled on the device in Basic mode. Advanced\u2014QoS is enabled on the device in Advanced mode. Step 3 Select Port/LAG and click GO to display/modify all ports/LAGs on the device and their CoS information. The following fields are displayed for all ports/LAGs: Interface\u2014Type of interface. Default CoS\u2014Default VPT value for incoming packets that do not have a VLAN Tag. The default CoS is 0. Step 4 Click Apply. The Running Configuration file is updated. To set QoS on an interface, select it, and click Edit. Step 5 Enter the parameters. Interface\u2014Select the port or LAG. Default CoS\u2014Select the default CoS (Class-of-Service) value to be assigned for incoming packets (that do not have a VLAN tag). Step 6 Click Apply. The interface default CoS value is saved to Running Configuration file. To restore the default CoS values, click Restore CoS Defaults. Queues The device supports 8 queues for each interface. Queue number eight is the highest priority queue. Queue number one is the lowest priority queue. There are two ways of determining how traffic in queues is handled, Strict Priority and Weighted Round Robin (WRR). Strict Priority\u2014Egress traffic from the highest-priority queue is transmitted first. Traffic from the lower queues is processed only after the highest queue has been transmitted, thus providing the highest level of priority of traffic to the highest numbered queue. Weighted Round Robin (WRR)\u2014In WRR mode the number of packets sent from the queue is proportional to the weight of the queue (the higher the weight the more frames are sent). For example, if there are a maximum of four queues possible and all four queues are WRR and the default weights are used, queue 1 receives 1/15 of the bandwidth (assuming all queues are saturated and there\u2019s congestion), queue 2 receives 2/15, queue 3 receives 4/15 and queue 4 receives 8 /15 of the bandwidth. The type of WRR algorithm used in the device isn\u2019t the standard Deficit WRR (DWRR), but rather Shaped Deficit WRR (SDWRR). The queuing modes can be selected in the Queue page. When the queuing mode is by strict priority, the priority sets the order in which queues are serviced, starting with the highest priority queue and going to the next lower queue when each queue is completed. When the queuing mode is Weighted Round Robin, queues are serviced until their quota has been used up and then another queue is serviced. It\u2019s also possible to assign some of the lower queues to WRR, while keeping some of the higher queues in strict priority. In this case traffic for the strict-priority queues is always sent before traffic from the WRR queues. Only after the strict-priority queues have been emptied is traffic from the WRR queues forwarded. (The relative portion from each WRR queue depends on its weight). To select the priority method and enter WRR data, complete the following steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Quality of Service > General > Queue. Step 2 Enter the parameters. Queue\u2014Displays the queue number. Scheduling Method\u2014Select one of the following options: Strict Priority\u2014Traffic scheduling for the selected queue and all higher queues is based strictly on the queue priority. WRR\u2014Traffic scheduling for the selected queue is based on WRR. The period time is divided between the WRR queues that aren\u2019t empty, meaning they have descriptors to egress. This division happens only if the strict-priority queues are empty. WRR Weight\u2014If WRR is selected, enter the WRR weight assigned to the queue. % of WRR Bandwidth\u2014Displays the amount of bandwidth assigned to the queue. These values represent the percent of the WRR weight. Step 3 Click Apply. The queues are configured, and the Running Configuration file is updated. CoS/802.1p to Queue The CoS/802.1p to Queue page maps 802.1p priorities to egress queues. The CoS/802.1p to Queue Table determines the egress queues of the incoming packets based on the 802.1p priority in their VLAN Tags. For incoming untagged packets, the 802.1p priority is the default CoS/802.1p priority assigned to the ingress ports. To map CoS values to egress queues, follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Quality of Service > General > CoS/802.1p to Queue. Step 2 Enter the parameters. 802.1p\u2014Displays the 802.1p priority tag values to be assigned to an egress queue, where 0 is the lowest and 7 is the highest priority. Output Queue\u2014Select the egress queue to which the 802.1p priority is mapped. Either four or eight egress queues are supported, where Queue 4 or Queue 8 is the highest priority egress queue and Queue 1 is the lowest priority. Step 3 For each 802.1p priority, select the Output Queue to which it is mapped. Step 4 Click Apply, Cancel or Restore Defaults. 801.1p priority values to queues are mapped, and the Running Configuration file is updated, the changes that entered are canceled, or previously defined values are restored. DSCP to Queue The DSCP (IP Differentiated Services Code Point) to Queue page maps DSCP values to egress queues. The DSCP to Queue Table determines the egress queues of the incoming IP packets based on their DSCP values. The original VPT (VLAN Priority Tag) of the packet is unchanged. By simply changing the DSCP to Queue mapping and the Queue schedule method and bandwidth allocation, it\u2019s possible to achieve the desired quality of services in a network. The DSCP to Queue mapping is applicable to IP packets if: The device is in QoS Basic mode and DSCP is the trusted mode. The device is in QoS Advanced mode and the packets belongs to flows that are DSCP trusted. Non-IP packets are always classified to the best-effort queue. The following tables describe the default DSCP to queue mapping for an 8-queue system where 7 is highest and 8 is used for stack control purposes.

The fields in this page are described in the Edit page below, except for the following fields: Ingress Rate Limit: Status\u2014Displays whether Ingress Rate Limit is enabled. Rate Limit (kbits/sec)\u2014Displays the ingress rate limit for the port. %\u2014Displays the ingress rate limit for the port divided by the total port bandwidth. CBS (Bytes)\u2014Maximum burst size of data for the ingress interface in bytes of data Egress Shaping Rates: Status\u2014Displays whether Egress Shaping Rates is enabled. CIR (kbits/sec)\u2014Displays the maximum bandwidth for the egress interface. CBS (Bytes)\u2014Maximum burst size of data for the egress interface in bytes of data Step 2 Select an interface, and click Edit. Step 3 Select the Port or LAG interface. Step 4 Enter the fields for the selected interface: Option Description Ingress Rate Limit Select to enable the ingress rate limit, which is defined in the field below. (Not relevant for LAGs). Ingress Rate Limit (kbits per sec) Enter the maximum amount of bandwidth allowed on the interface. (Not relevant for LAGs). Ingress Committed Burst Size (CBS) Enter the maximum burst size of data for the ingress interface in bytes of data. This amount can be sent even if it temporarily increases the bandwidth beyond the allowed limit. This field is only available if the interface is a port. (Not relevant for LAGs). Egress Shaping Rate Select to enable egress shaping on the interface. Committed Information Rate (CIR) (kbits/sec) Enter the maximum bandwidth for the egress interface. Egress Committed Burst Size (CBS) Enter the maximum burst size of data for the egress interface in bytes of data. This amount can be sent even if it temporarily increases the bandwidth beyond the allowed limit. Step 5 Click Apply. The bandwidth settings are written to the Running Configuration file. Egress Shaping per Queue This setting is only available in the Advanced Setting view. In addition to limiting transmission rate per port, which is done in the Bandwidth page, the device can limit the transmission rate of selected egressing frames on a per-queue per-port basis. Egress rate limiting is performed by shaping the output load. The device limits all frames except for management frames. Any frames that aren\u2019t limited are ignored in the rate calculations, meaning that their size isn\u2019t included in the limit total. To configure the egress shaping per queue, complete the following steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Quality of Service > General > Egress Shaping per Queue. The Egress Shaping Per Queue page displays the rate limit (CIR) and burst size (CBS) for each queue. Step 2 Select an interface type (Port or LAG), and click Go. Step 3 Select a Port/LAG, and click Edit. This page enables shaping the egress for up to eight queues on each interface. Step 4 Select the Interface. Step 5 For each queue that is required, enter the following fields: Enable Shaping\u2014Select to enable egress shaping on this queue. Committed Information Rate (CIR)\u2014Enter the maximum rate (CIR) in Kbits per second (Kbps). CIR is the average maximum amount of data that can be sent. Committed Burst Size (CBS)\u2014Enter the maximum burst size (CBS) in bytes. CBS is the maximum burst of data allowed to be sent even if a burst exceeds CIR. Step 6 Click Apply. The bandwidth settings are written to the Running Configuration file. VLAN Ingress Rate Limit This setting is only available in the Advanced Setting view. Rate limiting per VLAN, performed in the VLAN Ingress Rate Limit page, enables traffic limiting on VLANs. When VLAN ingress rate limiting is configured, it limits aggregate traffic from all the ports on the device. The following constraints apply to rate limiting per VLAN: It has lower precedence than any other traffic policing defined in the system. For example, if a packet is subject to QoS rate limits but is also subject to VLAN rate limiting, and the rate limits conflict, the QoS rate limits take precedence. It\u2019s applied at the device level and within the device at the packet processor level. If there\u2019s more than one packet processor on the device, the configured VLAN rate limit value is applied to each of the packet processors, independently. Devices with up to 24 ports have a single packet processor, while devices of 48 ports or more have two packet processors. Rate limiting is calculated separately for each packet processor in a unit. To define the VLAN ingress rate limit, complete the following steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Quality of Service > General > VLAN Ingress Rate Limit. This page displays the VLAN Ingress Rate Limit Table. Step 2 Click Add. Step 3 Enter the parameters. VLAN ID\u2014Select a VLAN. Committed Information Rate (CIR)\u2014Enter the average maximum amount of data that can be accepted into the VLAN in Kilobits per second. Committed Burst Size (CBS)\u2014Enter the maximum burst size of data for the egress interface in bytes of data. This amount can be sent even if it temporarily increases the bandwidth beyond the allowed limit. Can\u2019t be entered for LAGs. Step 4 Click Apply. The VLAN rate limit is added, and the Running Configuration file is updated. TCP Congestion Avoidance This setting is only available in the Advanced Setting view. The TCP Congestion Avoidance page enables activating a TCP congestion avoidance algorithm. The algorithm breaks up or avoids TCP global synchronization in a congested node, where the congestion is due to various sources sending packets with the same byte count. To configure TCP congestion avoidance complete the following steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Quality of Service > General > TCP Congestion Avoidance. Step 2 Click Enable to enable TCP congestion avoidance, and click Apply.",

    "page_content": "Queues The device supports 8 queues for each interface. Queue number eight is the highest priority queue. Queue number one is the lowest priority queue. There are two ways of determining how traffic in queues is handled, Strict Priority and Weighted Round Robin (WRR). Strict Priority\u2014Egress traffic from the highest-priority queue is transmitted first. Traffic from the lower queues is processed only after the highest queue has been transmitted, thus providing the highest level of priority of traffic to the highest numbered queue. Weighted Round Robin (WRR)\u2014In WRR mode the number of packets sent from the queue is proportional to the weight of the queue (the higher the weight the more frames are sent). For example, if there are a maximum of four queues possible and all four queues are WRR and the default weights are used, queue 1 receives 1/15 of the bandwidth (assuming all queues are saturated and there\u2019s congestion), queue 2 receives 2/15, queue 3 receives 4/15 and queue 4 receives 8 /15 of the bandwidth. The type of WRR algorithm used in the device isn\u2019t the standard Deficit WRR (DWRR), but rather Shaped Deficit WRR (SDWRR). The queuing modes can be selected in the Queue page. When the queuing mode is by strict priority, the priority sets the order in which queues are serviced, starting with the highest priority queue and going to the next lower queue when each queue is completed. When the queuing mode is Weighted Round Robin, queues are serviced until their quota has been used up and then another queue is serviced. It\u2019s also possible to assign some of the lower queues to WRR, while keeping some of the higher queues in strict priority. In this case traffic for the strict-priority queues is always sent before traffic from the WRR queues. Only after the strict-priority queues have been emptied is traffic from the WRR queues forwarded. (The relative portion from each WRR queue depends on its weight). To select the priority method and enter WRR data, complete the following steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Quality of Service > General > Queue. Step 2 Enter the parameters. Queue\u2014Displays the queue number. Scheduling Method\u2014Select one of the following options: Strict Priority\u2014Traffic scheduling for the selected queue and all higher queues is based strictly on the queue priority. WRR\u2014Traffic scheduling for the selected queue is based on WRR. The period time is divided between the WRR queues that aren\u2019t empty, meaning they have descriptors to egress. This division happens only if the strict-priority queues are empty. WRR Weight\u2014If WRR is selected, enter the WRR weight assigned to the queue. % of WRR Bandwidth\u2014Displays the amount of bandwidth assigned to the queue. These values represent the percent of the WRR weight. Step 3 Click Apply. The queues are configured, and the Running Configuration file is updated.",

    "page_content": "QoS Advanced Mode Frames that match an ACL and permitted entrance are implicitly labeled with the name of the ACL that permitted their entrance. Advanced mode QoS actions can then be applied to these flows. In QoS advanced mode, the device uses policies to support per flow QoS. A policy and its components have the following characteristics and relationships: A policy contains one or more class maps. A class map defines a flow with one or more associating ACLs. Packets that match only ACL rules (ACE) in a class map with Permit (forward) action are considered belonging to the same flow, and are subjected to the same quality of services. Thus, a policy contains one or more flows, each with a user defined QoS. The QoS of a class map (flow) is enforced by the associating policer. There are two type of policers, single policer and aggregate policer. Each policer is configured with a QoS specification. A single policer applies the QoS to a single class map, and thus to a single flow, based on the policer QoS specification. An aggregate policer applies the QoS to one or more class maps, and thus one or more flows. An aggregate policer can support class maps from different policies. Per flow QoS are applied to flows by binding the policies to the desired ports. A policy and its class maps can be bound to one or more ports, but each port is bound with at most one policy. Global Settings Out-of-Profile DSCP Mapping Class Mapping Aggregate Policer Policy Table Policy Class Maps Policy Binding Global Settings The Global Settings page contains information for enabling Trust on the device. Packets entering a QoS domain are classified at the edge of the QoS domain. To define the Trust configuration: Procedure Step 1 Click Quality of Service > QoS Advanced Mode > Global Settings. Step 2 Select the Trust Mode while the device is in Advanced mode. If a packet CoS level and DSCP tag are mapped to separate queues, the Trust mode determines the queue to which the packet is assigned: CoS/802.1p\u2014Traffic is mapped to queues based on the VPT field in the VLAN tag, or based on the per-port default CoS/802.1p value (if there\u2019s no VLAN tag on the incoming packet), the actual mapping of the VPT to queue can be configured in the mapping CoS/802.1p to Queue page. DSCP\u2014All IP traffic is mapped to queues based on the DSCP field in the IP header. The actual mapping of the DSCP to queue can be configured in the DSCP to Queue page. If traffic isn\u2019t IP traffic, it\u2019s mapped to the best effort queue. CoS/802.1p-DSCP\u2014Select to use Trust CoS mode for non-IP traffic and Trust DSCP for IP traffic. Step 3 Select the default Advanced mode QoS trust mode (either trusted or untrusted) for interfaces in the Default Mode Status field. This provides basic QoS functionality on Advanced QoS, so that you can trust CoS/DSCP on Advanced QoS by default (without having to create a policy). Step 4 In QoS Advanced Mode, when the Default Mode Status is set to Not Trusted, the default CoS values configured on the interface is ignored and all the traffic goes to queue 1. See the Quality of Service > QoS Advanced Mode > Global Settings page for details. Step 5 If you have a policy on an interface then the Default Mode is irrelevant, the action is according to the policy configuration and unmatched traffic is dropped. Step 6 Select Override Ingress DSCP to override the original DSCP values in the incoming packets with the new values according to the DSCP Override Table. When Override Ingress DSCP is enabled, the device uses the new DSCP values for egress queuing. It also replaces the original DSCP values in the packets with the new DSCP values. Note The frame is mapped to an egress queue using the new, rewritten value, and not by the original DSCP value. Step 7 If Override Ingress DSCP was enabled, click DSCP Override Table to reconfigure DSCP. In The DSCP Override Table, enter the following fields: DSCP In\u2014Displays the DSCP value of the incoming packet that needs to be remarked to an alternative value. DSCP Out\u2014Select the DSCP Out value to indicate the outgoing value is mapped. Click Apply. To go back to the default settings, click Restore Defaults. Out-of-Profile DSCP Mapping When a policer is assigned to a class maps (flows), you can specify the action to take when the amount of traffic in one or more flows exceeds the QoS-specified limits. The portion of the traffic that causes the flow to exceed its QoS limit is referred to as out-of-profile packets. If the exceed/violate action is Out of Profile DSCP, the device remaps the original DSCP value of the out-of-profile IP packets with a new value based on the Out of Profile DSCP Remarking Table. The device uses the new values to assign resources and the egress queues to these packets. The device also physically replaces the original DSCP value in the out of profile packets with the new DSCP value. To use the out-of-profile DSCP exceed action, remap the DSCP value in the Out Of Profile DSCP Remarking Table. Otherwise the action is null, because the DSCP value in the table remaps the packets to itself by factory default. This feature changes the DSCP tags for incoming traffic switched between trusted QoS domains. Changing the DSCP values used in one domain, sets the priority of that type of traffic to the DSCP value used in the other domain to identify the same type of traffic. These settings are active when the system is in the QoS Advance mode, and once activated they are active globally. This can be configured in the QoS Properties. To map DSCP values, follow these steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Quality of Service > QoS Advanced Mode > Out of Profile DSCP Mapping. This page enables setting the DSCP-value of traffic entering or leaving the device. DSCP In displays the DSCP value of the incoming packet that needs to be re-marked to an alternative value. Step 2 Select the DSCP Out value to where the incoming value is mapped. Step 3 Click Apply. The Running Configuration file is updated with the new DSCP Remarking table. Step 4 Click Restore Defaults to restore the factory CoS default setting for this interface. Class Mapping A Class Map defines a traffic flow with ACLs (Access Control Lists) defined on it. A MAC ACL, IP ACL, and IPv6 ACL can be combined into a class map. Class maps are configured to match packet criteria on a match-all or match-any basis. They are matched to packets on a first-fit basis, meaning that the action associated with the first-matched class map is the action performed by the system. Packets that match the same class map are considered to belong to the same flow. Note Defining class maps doesn\u2019t have any effect on QoS; it\u2019s an interim step, enabling the class maps to be used later. If more complex sets of rules are needed, several class maps can be grouped into a supergroup called a policy. In the same class map, a MAC ACL can\u2019t be used with an IPv6 ACE that has a Destination IPv6 address as a filtering condition. The Class Mapping page shows the list of defined class maps and the ACLs comprising each, and enables you to add/delete class maps. To define a Class Map, complete the following steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Quality of Service > QoS Advanced Mode > Class Mapping. For each class map, the ACLs defined on it are displayed along with the relationship between them. Up to three ACLs can be displayed along with their Match, which can be either And or Or. This indicates the relationship between the ACLs. The Class Map is then the result of the three ACLs combined with either And or Or. Step 2 Click Add. A new class map is added by selecting one or two ACLs and giving the class map a name. If a class map has two ACLs, you can specify that a frame must match both ACLs, or that it must match either one or both of the ACLs selected. Step 3 Enter the parameters. Class Map Name\u2014Enter the name of a new class map. Match ACL Type\u2014The criteria that a packet must match in order to be considered to belong to the flow defined in the class map. The options are: IP\u2014A packet must match either of the IP-based ACLs in the class map. MAC\u2014A packet must match the MAC-based ACL in the class map. IP and MAC\u2014A packet must match the IP-based ACL and the MAC-based ACL in the class map. IP or MAC\u2014A packet must match either the IP-based ACL or the MAC-based ACL in the class map. IP\u2014Select the IPv4 based ACL or the IPv6 based ACL for the class map. MAC\u2014Select the MAC-based ACL for the class map. Preferred ACL\u2014Select whether packets are first matched to an IP or MAC. Step 4 Click Apply. The Running Configuration file is updated. Aggregate Policer You can measure the rate of traffic that matches a predefined set of rules. To enforce limits, use ACLs in one or more class maps to match the desired traffic, and use a policer to apply the QoS on the matching traffic. A policer is configured with a QoS specification. There are two kinds of policers: Single (Regular) Policer\u2014A single policer applies the QoS to a single class map, and to a single flow based on the policer's QoS specification. When a class map using single policer is bound to multiple ports, each port has its own instance of single policer. Thus, each applying the QoS on the class map (flow) at ports that are otherwise independent of each other. A single policer is created in the Policy Table page. Aggregate Policer\u2014An aggregate policer applies the QoS to one or more class maps, and one or more flows. An aggregation policer can support class maps from different policies. An aggregate policer applies QoS to all its flows in aggregation regardless of policies and ports. An aggregate policer is created in the Aggregate Policer page. An aggregate policer is defined if the policer is to be shared with more than one class. Policers on a port can\u2019t be shared with other policers in another device. Each policer is defined with its own QoS specification with a combination of the following parameters: Peak Enforcement\u2014Select to enable action if peak burst size is exceeded. Peak Information Rate (PIR)\u2014Enter the peak traffic rate (PIR) in kbits per second (kbps). Peak Burst Size (PBS)\u2014Enter the peak burst size (PIR) in bytes. Violate Action\u2014Select one of the following actions if peak size is exceeded: Drop\u2014Drop the frames violating the peak size. Out-of-Profile DSCP\u2014Mark frames violating the peak size with the DSCP value with previously set DSCP value A maximum allowed rate, called a Committed Information Rate (CIR), measured in Kbps. An amount of traffic, measured in bytes, called a Committed Burst Size (CBS). This is traffic that is allowed to pass as a temporary burst even if it\u2019s above the defined maximum rate. An action to be applied to frames that are over the limits (called out-of-profile traffic), where such frames can be passed as is, dropped, or passed, but remapped to a new DSCP value that marks them as lower-priority frames for all subsequent handling within the device. Configures traffic policing on the basis of the specified rates and optional actions Enter the CIR and these optional values and actions Assigning a policer to a class map is done when a class map is added to a policy. If the policer is an aggregate policer, you must create it using the Aggregate Policer page. To define an aggregate policer, complete the following steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Quality of Service > QoS Advanced Mode > Aggregate Policer. This page displays the existing aggregate policers. Step 2 Click Add. Step 3 Enter the parameters. Aggregate Policer Name\u2014Enter the name of the Aggregate Policer. Ingress Committed Information Rate (CIR)\u2014Enter the maximum bandwidth allowed in bits per second. See the description of this in the Bandwidth. Ingress Committed Burst Size (CBS)\u2014Enter the maximum burst size (even if it goes beyond the CIR) in bytes. See the description of this in the Bandwidth. Exceed Action\u2014Select the action to be performed on incoming packets that exceed the CIR. Possible values are: Drop\u2014Packets exceeding the defined CIR value are dropped. Out of Profile DSCP\u2014The DSCP values of packets exceeding the defined CIR value are remapped to a value based on the Out Of Profile DSCP Remarking Table. Step 4 Click Apply. The Running Configuration file is updated. Policy Table The Policy Table Map page displays the list of advanced QoS policies defined in the system. The page also allows you to create and delete policies. Only those policies that are bound to an interface are active (see Policy Binding). Each policy consists of: One or more class maps of ACLs which define the traffic flows in the policy. One or more aggregates that applies the QoS to the traffic flows in the policy. After a policy has been added, class maps can be added by using the Policy Table page. To add a QoS policy, complete the following steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Quality of Service > QoS Advanced Mode > Policy Table. This page displays the list of defined policies. Step 2 Click Policy Class Map Table to display the Policy Class Maps page or click Add to open the Add Policy Table page. Step 3 Enter the name of the new policy in the New Policy Name field. Step 4 Click Apply. The QoS policy profile is added, and the Running Configuration file is updated. Policy Class Maps One or more class maps can be added to a policy. A class map defines the type of packets that are considered to belong to the same traffic flow. To add a class map to a policy: Procedure Step 1 Click Quality of Service > QoS Advanced Mode > Policy Class Maps. Step 2 Select a policy in the Filter, and click Go. All class maps in that policy are displayed. Step 3 To add a new class map, click Add. Step 4 Enter the following parameters. Policy Name Displays the policy to which the class map is being added. Class Map Name Select an existing class map to be associated with the policy. Class maps are created in the Class Mapping page. Action Type Select the action regarding the ingress CoS/802.1p and/or DSCP value of all the matching packets. Use default trust mode\u2014If this option is selected, use the default mode status in Global Trust mode. If the default mode status is \u201cNot Trusted\u201d, ignore the ingress CoS/802.1p and/or DSCP value and the matching packets are sent as best effort. Always Trust\u2014If this option is selected, the device trusts the matching packet based on the Global Trust mode (selected in the Global Settings page). It ignores the Default Mode status (selected in the Global Settings page). Set\u2014If this option is selected, use the value entered in the New Value box to determine the egress queue of the matching packets as follows: If the new value (0.7) is a CoS/802.1p priority, use the priority value and the CoS/802.1p to Queue Table to determine the egress queue of all the matching packets. If the new value (0.63) is a DSCP, use the new DSCP and the DSCP to Queue Table to determine the egress queue of the matching IP packets. Otherwise, use the new value (1.8) as the egress queue number for all the matching packets. Police Type Select the policer type for the policy. The options are: None\u2014No policy is used. Single\u2014The policer for the policy is a single policer. Aggregate\u2014The policer for the policy is an aggregate policer. Step 5 If Police Type is Aggregate, select the Aggregate Policer, and enter the following QoS parameters: Ingress Committed Information Rate (CIR) Enter the CIR in Kbps. See a description of this in the Bandwidth page. Ingress Committed Burst Size (CBS) Enter the CBS in bytes. See a description of this in the Bandwidth page. Exceed Action Select the action assigned to incoming packets exceeding the CIR. The options are: Drop\u2014Packets exceeding the defined CIR value are dropped. Out of Profile DSCP\u2014IP packets exceeding the defined CIR are forwarding with a new DSCP derived from the Out Of Profile DSCP Remarking Table. Step 6 Click Apply. Policy Binding The Policy Binding page shows which policy profile is bound and to which port. A policy can be bound to an interface as an ingress (input) policy or as an egress (output) policy. When a policy profile is bound to a specific port, it\u2019s active on that port. Only one policy profile can be configured per port and per direction. However, a single policy can be bound to more than one port. When a policy is bound to a port, it filters and applies QoS to traffic that belongs to the flows defined in the policy. To edit a policy, it must first be removed (unbound) from all those ports to which it\u2019s bound. Note It\u2019s possible to either bind a port to a policy or to an ACL but both can\u2019t be bound. To define policy binding, complete the following steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Quality of Service > QoS Advanced Mode > Policy Binding. Step 2 Select an Interface Type if required. Step 3 Click Go. The policies for that interface are displayed. Step 4 Click Edit. Step 5 Select the interface (Port or Lag) and configure the following: Input Policy Binding\u2014Select to bind the input policy to the interface. Policy Name\u2014Select the input policy being bound. Default Action\u2014Select action if packet matches policy: Deny Any\u2014Select to forward packets on the interface if they match any policy. Permit Any\u2014Select to forward packets on the interface if they don\u2019t match any policy. Note Permit Any can be defined only if IP Source Guard isn\u2019t activated on the interface. Step 6 Select Enable to enable the Output Policy Binding and configure the following: Policy Name\u2014Select the output policy being bound. Default Action\u2014Select action if packet matches policy: Deny Any\u2014Select to forward packets on the interface if they match any policy. Permit Any\u2014Select to forward packets on the interface if they don\u2019t match any policy. Note Permit Any can be defined only if IP Source Guard isn\u2019t activated on the interface. Step 7 Click Apply. The QoS policy binding is defined, and the Running Configuration file is updated.",

    "page_content": "Class Mapping A Class Map defines a traffic flow with ACLs (Access Control Lists) defined on it. A MAC ACL, IP ACL, and IPv6 ACL can be combined into a class map. Class maps are configured to match packet criteria on a match-all or match-any basis. They are matched to packets on a first-fit basis, meaning that the action associated with the first-matched class map is the action performed by the system. Packets that match the same class map are considered to belong to the same flow. Note Defining class maps doesn\u2019t have any effect on QoS; it\u2019s an interim step, enabling the class maps to be used later. If more complex sets of rules are needed, several class maps can be grouped into a supergroup called a policy. In the same class map, a MAC ACL can\u2019t be used with an IPv6 ACE that has a Destination IPv6 address as a filtering condition. The Class Mapping page shows the list of defined class maps and the ACLs comprising each, and enables you to add/delete class maps. To define a Class Map, complete the following steps: Procedure Step 1 Click Quality of Service > QoS Advanced Mode > Class Mapping. For each class map, the ACLs defined on it are displayed along with the relationship between them. Up to three ACLs can be displayed along with their Match, which can be either And or Or. This indicates the relationship between the ACLs. The Class Map is then the result of the three ACLs combined with either And or Or. Step 2 Click Add. A new class map is added by selecting one or two ACLs and giving the class map a name. If a class map has two ACLs, you can specify that a frame must match both ACLs, or that it must match either one or both of the ACLs selected. Step 3 Enter the parameters. Class Map Name\u2014Enter the name of a new class map. Match ACL Type\u2014The criteria that a packet must match in order to be considered to belong to the flow defined in the class map. The options are: IP\u2014A packet must match either of the IP-based ACLs in the class map. MAC\u2014A packet must match the MAC-based ACL in the class map. IP and MAC\u2014A packet must match the IP-based ACL and the MAC-based ACL in the class map. IP or MAC\u2014A packet must match either the IP-based ACL or the MAC-based ACL in the class map. IP\u2014Select the IPv4 based ACL or the IPv6 based ACL for the class map. MAC\u2014Select the MAC-based ACL for the class map. Preferred ACL\u2014Select whether packets are first matched to an IP or MAC. Step 4 Click Apply. The Running Configuration file is updated.",

    "page_content": "Aggregate Policer You can measure the rate of traffic that matches a predefined set of rules. To enforce limits, use ACLs in one or more class maps to match the desired traffic, and use a policer to apply the QoS on the matching traffic. A policer is configured with a QoS specification. There are two kinds of policers: Single (Regular) Policer\u2014A single policer applies the QoS to a single class map, and to a single flow based on the policer's QoS specification. When a class map using single policer is bound to multiple ports, each port has its own instance of single policer. Thus, each applying the QoS on the class map (flow) at ports that are otherwise independent of each other. A single policer is created in the Policy Table page. Aggregate Policer\u2014An aggregate policer applies the QoS to one or more class maps, and one or more flows. An aggregation policer can support class maps from different policies. An aggregate policer applies QoS to all its flows in aggregation regardless of policies and ports. An aggregate policer is created in the Aggregate Policer page. An aggregate policer is defined if the policer is to be shared with more than one class. Policers on a port can\u2019t be shared with other policers in another device. Each policer is defined with its own QoS specification with a combination of the following parameters: Peak Enforcement\u2014Select to enable action if peak burst size is exceeded. Peak Information Rate (PIR)\u2014Enter the peak traffic rate (PIR) in kbits per second (kbps). Peak Burst Size (PBS)\u2014Enter the peak burst size (PIR) in bytes.

Out-of-Profile DSCP\u2014Mark frames violating the peak size with the DSCP value with previously set DSCP value A maximum allowed rate, called a Committed Information Rate (CIR), measured in Kbps. An amount of traffic, measured in bytes, called a Committed Burst Size (CBS). This is traffic that is allowed to pass as a temporary burst even if it\u2019s above the defined maximum rate. An action to be applied to frames that are over the limits (called out-of-profile traffic), where such frames can be passed as is, dropped, or passed, but remapped to a new DSCP value that marks them as lower-priority frames for all subsequent handling within the device. Configures traffic policing on the basis of the specified rates and optional actions Enter the CIR and these optional values and actions Assigning a policer to a class map is done when a class map is added to a policy.

However, neither the frames nor the community string is encrypted. Therefore, SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 aren\u2019t secure. In SNMPv3, the following security mechanisms can be configured. Authentication\u2014The device checks that the SNMP user is an authorized system administrator. This is done for each frame. Privacy\u2014SNMP frames can carry encrypted data. Thus, in SNMPv3, there are three levels of security: No security (No authentication and no privacy) Authentication (Authentication and no privacy) Authentication and privacy SNMPv3 provides a means of controlling the content each user can read or write and the notifications they receive. A group defines read/write privileges and a level of security. It becomes operational when it\u2019s associated with an SNMP user or community. Note To associate a non-default view with a group, first create the view in the SNMP Views. To create an SNMP group, complete the following steps: Procedure Step 1 Click SNMP > Groups. This page contains the existing SNMP groups and their security levels. Step 2 Click Add. Step 3 Enter the parameters. Group Name\u2014Enter a new group name. Security Model\u2014Select the SNMP version attached to the group, SNMPv1, v2, or v3. Three types of views with various security levels can be defined. For each security level, select the views for Read, Write, and Notify by entering the following fields: Enable\u2014Select this field to enable the Security Level. Security Level\u2014Define the security level attached to the group. SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 support neither authentication nor privacy. If SNMPv3 is selected, choose one of the following: No Authentication and No Privacy\u2014Neither the Authentication nor the Privacy security levels are assigned to the group. Authentication and No Privacy\u2014Authenticates SNMP messages, and ensures that the SNMP message origin is authenticated but doesn\u2019t encrypt them. Authentication and Privacy\u2014Authenticates SNMP messages, and encrypts them. View\u2014Select to associate a view with either read, write, and/or notify access privileges of the group limits the scope of the MIB tree to which the group has read, write, and notify access. Read\u2014Management access is read-only for the selected view. Otherwise, a user or a community associated with this group is able to read all MIBs except those that control SNMP itself. Write\u2014Management access is written for the selected view. Otherwise, a user or a community associated with this group is able to write all MIBs except those that control SNMP itself. Notify\u2014Limits the available content of the traps to those included in the selected view. Otherwise, there\u2019s no restriction on the contents of the traps.
