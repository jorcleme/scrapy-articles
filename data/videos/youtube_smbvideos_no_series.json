    "transcript": "hello everyone thanks for joining my name is max harbin i'm with cisco small business pre-sales i'm going to be demonstrating for you today one of our exciting new patented features voice services discovery protocol in conjunction with uh smb features on our 200 300 and 500 series switches i'll be demonstrating for you uh network wide zero touch voice deployment so it happens kind of quick so this link i'm gonna do last so let's get in the lab and get started okay so here is our physical lab i put together some spa 504s 514s some 525s i have some 7900 series ip phones i connected a wap 371 this is the cca tool that's used to configure the uc and also i have well there's some other 7900 series i also connected pvc 2300 so we can demonstrate when the voice services discovery protocol propagates what it will and won't send the voice vlan to our competitor switches our uc and the rv 320 so there's our physical lab so let's get into the configuration all right so here we are at the config portion basically what i did i factory defaulted all the switches uh our competitors as well as ours and so we have nothing but vlan 1. so let's look at the 200 just vlan 1. the 300 just vlan 1 is there and down to the 500 is just vlan 1. like i said these are all just factory default settings on these just to kind of show you the purpose of how this is all going to work so we're going to look at the let's go to the voice vlan section notice we have the enable auto voice vlan and by external voice trigger that's the default settings and so let's look at our port vlan membership just to kind of show all the way down the line it's just vlan 1 as well on all of the switches so let's find that on here and then finally on the sg 500 so we're going to look at our vlan membership there so factory default nothing but vlan 1 across there so we need to get our voice vlan 100 propagated from our uc device down so what i'm going to do i'm going to connect the cable from ge8 to the expansion port on the uc 540 and once it did that there you notice that the the save started coming up indicating a change that is the voice vlan 100 being propagated it'll show you here it's set up as a static vlan on the 200 switch also let's go to the 300 and looks like it's propagating there and let's confirm that there it is and let's jump to the sg 500 and we're going to do the same so let's look at our vlans and there's voice vlan 100 so let's take a peek at our port vlan membership and we'll notice now on our access ports all the phones uh g1 7 and 10 as our access point notice uh ge2 there's 26 that's our uplink ge2 did not get it that's our pvc 2300 which is our camera that need voice so not gonna put it there i just put it there so you guys could see that for demonstration purposes that it will push where it's prevalent and it won't where it isn't so got all that set so let's jump back up to the 200. let's take a look at it support vlan membership looks like all the trunks are there oh ge2 is linked to our netgear so let me see if i can add a phone and do some manual config to get that up so here we go and we'll we'll come back to this a little bit later like i put in the annotation here and we'll show you how this is actually going to work and bring everything up so let me save this real quick and then we'll jump over to our competitor side and show you a little bit of what i had to go through for those now remember these were factory defaulted as well so starting fair on both ends so let's get logged in trying to do all the configs for these from the web gui side um i was able to do add vlan 100 here from the web gui and it is uh the voice vlan now but i was not able to find that in the web so added voice vlan to all the ports via this connection down here and then i actually had to go back into command line for the hp and define it as voice vlan so the qos the only option i really had here to choose was deferential services which kind of made the most sense for what we're doing i'm not sure that's right yet but on the d-link side here as well nothing automatic the vlan did not propagate so i had to go here and add it and add the voice vlan create it and enable it add it across all the ports here the voice vlan was not enabled i had to enable this here from the factory default that was disabled and so i had to make some changes on this end as well and then also go down and we'll look at the section about um the lldp med in a little bit but let me show you the netgear real quick um here's logged in i went into the vlan i was able to add oh looks like it's going to make me log in again bear with me okay here we go starting to come back up so on the switch side here when we were looking at this i added the voice vlan 100 and had some problems with the browser and i'll kind of explain all that here a little bit so defined the voice vlan went into the advanced section looked at the vlan membership and the drop down there for the vlan id but i had no means to add or tag across the port so after about 20 minutes of searching on your site he said i had to use an older browser so i pulled up an old opera and let me get that logged in here and then i'll show you how i added that to the access ports for this switch so back into switching into our vlan we're going to advanced our vlan membership now you see the ability to add that as tagged or untagged across so i'm going to choose our vlan 100 i'll go ahead and use our unit and this is where i had it tagged all the way across for ease sake back to the d-link here i wanted to show you as well like the global settings for it like on most of these the was all disabled so let's enable this real quick and apply it and by that time i hope this phone will come back up here on this d-link side and we'll see if we get that uh trunk to the 200 back up and everything talking so let's jump over to the 200 real quick and let's go back down to our port vlan membership and there we go on ge2 100 is there our vsdp in conjunction with our smart ports and everything recognized via the intelligence that it did need 100 on there because we do have a a voice endpoint requesting it once we created the manual path from the competitor switches so now let's look at it from a uc perspective here all the phones they're up and registered most voice engineers usually configure those prior but let's say they forgot one so we're gonna have to do one from scratch so let's go to users and phones and i just sent an engineer out for example let's say we sent them out with a factory defaulted phone of course we see here's the listing of the phones again that are configured and on the uc so we're going to send one out from a factory default state we're gonna connect that to i guess we'll go to the sg500 downstream but let me get some stuff set up here on the uc so we can see the communication we're gonna do a debug tftp packets and let's do debug tftp events and then we'll get started on that so let me click begin okay our debugging is running from the uc side so let's go to the switch like i said we're gonna do port two so let's look at it from the phone's perspective see in a few okay so here we are at the phone and we're gonna as factor defaulted this is a spa 525 g2 so i'm going to plug it into port 2 on the sg500 sorry about the shaky camera i'm trying to do this with one hand so all right we get that plugged in and let's go back to the phone so you can see what's going on there the phone is starting to power up and as it starts to power up it's gonna communicate to the uc to see if it's got the right config information get its ip address all that good stuff so the system is booting it's checking the ethernet that's good so it should be getting its ip there it goes now as it goes through it's going to look and see about its config notice there's no config because we just set this thing up so it's going to reboot itself it's going to come back up and let's see what state we're in so we're booting again ethernet and ip and so our next step if it's not it should upgrade let's see what it's doing yep it's pulling its config file down so the firmware version should be close to the same i wouldn't think that it'd have to do much so it's connecting registering there it says pre-sales lab of course it has no extension so see you back on the switch side and we'll see the rest later all right so now we're back at the sg 500 let me jump to the port vlan membership there we are ge2 added automatically didn't have to make any changes myself so let's jump to the uc let's hit end so we see the phone talking to the uc getting its information like normal like you would expect with everything configured as it needs to be so that's good and so just to finalize the rest of this up i'm going to go in real quick and let's refresh and update this we should see the phone actually here registered with no info there we go so i'm going to do an edit i'm going to add it send the rest of the config to it jump back to the phone and we'll conclude our video at that point so let me get the rest of this typed in pretty easy so far huh so looking at it from the cisco side been nothing really but uh plug and play for the most part and just uh the config on the call manager side and that's done but from a switch perspective the only thing i've done this whole lab is pointing cables plug in one cable for the cisco side not quite so much for the competitors but you know that's part of the process that's why we stand out so let's say okay to this get this going this is good we're okay there it is on the switch so one last time from the phone and then we'll be done okay guys now as you can see it's got extension 240 and it's uh ready to get up and dial out so bring it across we're done",

    "transcript": "[Music] hello and welcome to this episode of stocking Solutions labs and Demos in this video we'll go over how to configure chain and ring topologies on the sg550 XG and sg350 XG stackable switches please note however that the sg550 XG and sg350 XG cannot be linked in the same stack for all device is shown in this video we'll be using software version 2.1.0 46 let's get started [Music] a chain topology is a linear connection between all units via stacking links starting with one switch each unit connects to its neighboring switch through a single cable between their stack ports until the last unit has been linked with the one before it if a link between the two units fails the switch stack will be cut off where the fail occurs for this reason a chain topology is not very robust as it does not have full redundancy this is where ring topologies have an advantage in a ring topology all units in the stack are connected in a loop with the last unit connecting back to the first by connecting them in this way you provide additional redundancy in the case of a failed stack link as seen here the failure of one Link in a ring topology causes the stack to revert to a chain topology and maintains the Stack's functionality thus a ring topology is more reliable than a chain topology and allows for more stable stack operation let's show you how to physically set up each topology for this demonstration we'll be using four sg550 XG switches in a chain topology keep in mind that you can use any network port on the switch as a stack Port let's start by taking a cable and connecting the first and second switch together take note of the ports you connect to on each switch you'll need this information when designating stock ports lat here then take another cable and connect the second and third switch together repeat this process for every switch you want to include in your stack a ring topology uses the same configuration as a chain except the last unit connects back to the first therefore in order to make the stack a ring topology we just connect the last switch back to the first one now that we have physically established a ring topology we'll go over their configurations in the graphical user interface this is where we designate the appropriate ports for each unit that will be used to stack [Music] for each switch you'll need to log into the web Configuration utility to configure the stock ports start by logging into the first switch at the top of your stack and then click on Administration and then stack management the stack management page shows your current stock topology and designates which switch in your stack is the stack Master additionally it provides a visual stack topology view of your current stack since your stack ports haven't been configured yet each switch is designated as a the master of its own single unit chain topology under the unit View and stack Port configuration section you can simply click on the ports you want to designate as stacking ports for the switch these should be the same ports you use to connect your switches earlier note that in order to enable stacking at least two stacking ports must be selected in the graphically user interface by default there are no preconfigured stack ports on the switch you can designate two to four stacking ports in the SG 350 XG and two eight stacking ports on the sg550 XG in the unit ID after reset drop-down list choose Auto in order to automatically assign each stack member a unique unit ID the assignment process will be based on each unit's Mac address and determine the initial Master backup and slave units finally click apply and reboot to save your changes a confirmation window will open asking if you would like to continue click okay and your device will reboot now we simply need to configure the stock ports for the other three switches using the same procedure log into each switch's web Configuration utility navigate to Administration and then stock management and designate the appropriate ports we are using in the physical setup after the changes have been applied and all switches have finished rebooting the 4 unit stack will be established once we log into our stack master and navigate to Administration and stack management we can view new updated information on the stack under stack topology view all four units of the current ring topology appear and we can select each individual switch for stack configuration clicking on individual unit will show you which of its stacking ports are active and whether the unit is a master backup or slave within the topology a brief overview of your stack configuration can also be found in your master switches system summary if you click on status and statistics then system summary you can view the units in your stack as well as individual switch serial numbers and pvid numbers the sg350 XG and sg550 XG switches support stacking under two types of topologies ring and chain a ring topology is more favorable than a chain topology due to its additional redundancy however both topologies can be used to establish a functional stack to configure each topology you need to physically link ports between each switch and then designate those ports as stack ports in the graphical user interface this concludes our tutorial on ring and chain topologies for more information please please see the article below or check out the Cisco small business support Community for further assistance I'm Remy from Cisco and thanks for watching this episode of stacking

    "transcript": "STACKING IS A FEATURE AVAILABLE ON SELECT\nCISCO SMALL BUSINESS SWITCHES. TO UNDERSTAND THIS FEATURE AND ITS BENEFITS, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME BASIC STACKING CONCEPTS AND TERMS. FIRST, LET'S DEFINE WHAT A STACK IS. A STACK IS A NETWORK SOLUTION COMPOSED OF TWO OR MORE STACKABLE SWITCHES. SWITCHES THAT ARE PART OF A STACK BEHAVE AS ONE SINGLE DEVICE. AS A RESULT, A STACKING SOLUTION SHOWS THE CHARACTERISTICS AND FUNCTIONALITY OF A SINGLE SWITCH, WHILE HAVING AN INCREASED NUMBER OF PORTS. THIS ALLOWS USERS TO EXPAND THEIR NETWORK CAPACITY WITHOUT THE HASSLE OF MANAGING MULTIPLE DEVICES. ADDITIONALLY, SWITCHES CAN BE ADDED OR REMOVED FROM A STACK AS NEEDED WITHOUT AFFECTING THE OVERALL OPERATION OF THE STACK. DEPENDING ON ITS TOPOLOGY, A STACK CAN CONTINUE TO TRANSFER DATA EVEN IF A LINK OR UNIT WITHIN THE STACK FAILS. THIS MAKES STACKING AN EFFECTIVE, FLEXIBLE, AND SCALABLE SOLUTION TO EXPAND NETWORK CAPACITY. NOW THAT WE HAVE A GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT A STACK IS AND WHY YOU WOULD WANT TO CONSIDER A STACK FOR YOUR NETWORK, LET'S GO OVER SOME BASIC STACKNG TERMS THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW BEFORE SETTING ONE UP. FIRST, A STACK HAS A MASTER, OR COMMANDER. THE MASTER IS A SWITCH IN THE STACK THAT HANDLES THE CONFIGURATION FOR THE ENTIRE STACK. WHEN YOU WANT TO MANAGE YOUR STACK, THE MASTER UNIT IS THE DEVICE THAT YOU CONNECT TO IN ORDER TO MAKE CHANGES. THE MASTER ALSO HANDLES OTHER IMPORTANT STACK FUNCTIONS SUCH AS, DETECTING WHEN SWITCHES ENTER OR LEAVE THE STACK, AND UPGRADING OUTDATED SWITCHES. THE BACKUP IS A SWITCH THAT WILL BECOME THE NEW MASTER IF THE ORIGINAL MASTER GOES OFFLINE. IN THIS WAY, A BACKUP HELPS MAINTAIN THE RESILIENCY OF THE STACK. A SLAVE, OR MEMBER, SERVES AS AN ADDITIONAL UNIT WITHIN THE STACK. UNLIKE THE MASTER AND THE BACKUP UNITS, THE SLAVE DOES NOT SERVE AN ADDITIONAL FUNCTION WITHIN THE STACK OTHER THAN TO INCREASE PORT CAPACITY. AS A RESULT, IF THE MASTER AND BACKUP UNITS FAIL, THE STACK WILL BECOME DISABLED. FINALLY,\nA STACK PORT IS A PORT ON THE SWITCH THAT IS USED TO COMMUNICATE WITH OTHER SWITCHES IN THE STACK. DEPENDING ON THE MODEL, A SWITCH CAN HAVE EITHER PRECONFIGURED OR USER-DEFINED STACK PORTS. NOW THAT WE'VE GONE OVER THESE BASIC STACKING CONCEPTS AND TERMS, YOU'VE HOPEFULLY GAINED A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT A STACK IS AND HOW ONE WOULD FIT IN TO YOUR NETWORK.

    "transcript": "when you first set up your office you created your own local area network a lan a lan needs an internet service provider isp modem and a router to get access to the internet once you connected at least one computer or another device for internet access voila you had your own lan moving beyond that initial connection over time you may have added your own router switch computers phones security cameras or printers no matter how many devices are on your lan by default every end device is put into one big group called a broadcast domain by default all ports are put into vlan 1. all resources are shared and available within this group a single broadcast domain works fine in a small network but now that your company has grown you may want to separate traffic into virtual lands called vlans you won't see these separated networks but they may be just what you need in this episode of cisco tech talk i'll explain vlans and their benefits next to start i'll explain a little more about broadcast domains to give you a visual think of a switch like a mail room in an office building when you have one broadcast domain every time a switch receives a broadcast packet it sends the message out to everyone every mailbox besides where the message originated it's like spam everybody gets it whether it applies to the receiver or not if there are many messages sent out and getting flooded out to everyone this can be a burden on the switch or in my comparison that poor overworked mail room worker limiting broadcast messages to a smaller relevant group is important as there are many messages happening in the background of a network that you don't even see having separate broadcast domains can also keep information and resources restricted to those that require access it's like delivering sealed envelopes to certain mailboxes not intended for prying eyes for example you may have a server that you only want management to be able to access in another situation you may want the accounting server access available only to the accounting department this process is built in when vlans are in place another great benefit is that you can set up vlans and no one needs to move the location of their workspace since the separation is virtual the physical location doesn't matter this means that you can have people working in accounting sales and marketing scattered between different floors and you won't need to add any extra equipment to make it work beyond the general process of separating traffic on vlans you can further customize them you can allow one or more vlans to communicate with each other you can also add access from more than one vlan to a certain resource in your network like a server this is called inter vlan routing if you want to save your switch from having to use a separate switch port for each vlan you can set up trunk ports trunk ports carry the data of more than one vlan so when a message is sent it has a tag attached for a specific vlan this tells the switch where to send the traffic this is all done without you seeing any of these tags they are attached at arrival to the switch and then removed when they are sent to their destination like the mail room all that work is done behind the scenes in contrast access ports are ports that only carry traffic for one vlan if a port is configured as an access port it doesn't need to carry a tag to keep traffic differentiated in this case the port would be considered an access port that carries untagged traffic when you configure a vlan you assign switch ports to one or more vlans this is where you assign the ports as trunk or access as well as tagged or untagged instead of by department some vlans are set up to separate different types of traffic like voice and data some businesses even set up a guest vlan to keep that traffic independent from the rest you really can customize the vlans for whatever works best for you if you're ready to configure vlans on your network you can go to cisco.com click support and then enter your switch model from here you will find documentation on setting up vlans specific to your switch model in addition videos on vlan configuration can be found at www.video.cisco.com thanks for watching i'll see you next time [Music] you",

    "transcript": "have you ever heard the saying the only constant in life is change it's true change is inevitable and technology advancements are a prime example of that altering the face of the world and how we live in it when setting up or expanding your network even if you use the latest technology there are some traditional methods to follow to keep a good handle on your network configuration this includes documenting the topology of your network and strategically setting some static ip addresses where needed the safest way to do this is manually in general networks are mainly configured with dynamic ip addresses given out by a dynamic host configuration protocol dhcp server however if you need constant access to a device or server in the network it would be beneficial for a specific ip address to stay the same in this edition of cisco tech talk i'll go over some best practices for setting up static ip addresses [Music] i'll start with a little more detail about ip addresses cisco business hardware uses private ip addresses for the local area network lan by default out of the box some equipment comes with a default ip address that you can use to access the web user interface rv series routers come with an ip of 192.168.1.1 cisco business switches 192.168.1.254 and cisco business wireless access points 192.168.1 once those devices are deployed in a dhcp network they will be assigned ip addresses usually chosen from the 192.168.1-0-24-ip pool of addresses these are dynamic and can change over time within the dhcp pool addresses you do have other options for private ip pools including a 10.0.0.088 network or a 172.16.0.0.12 network when you configure the ip address statically no matter what pool of addresses you configure for your network make sure to document the topology and relevant details be sure to note all devices and static ip addresses you configure along with the media access control mac address of each device this is the unique identification number of each piece of hardware when adding static ip addresses there are some important things to keep in mind make sure each ip address is unique in a network if two ip addresses are the same those devices won't be able to communicate on the network duplications can happen in two ways the first is if you assign the same static ip address to two devices it seems unlikely but it does happen this can be prevented if you keep those detailed notes on the topology of your network that was mentioned earlier the second way for duplications to happen is if you set a static ip address on one device and then dhcp assigns the same ip address to another device on the same network this can be prevented by setting up one pool of addresses for dhcp to assign at random and then a separate pool of addresses that is set aside for static ip addressing that way they won't overlap for example create a pool from 192.168.1.50 to 192.168.1.99 for static ip addressing and 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.149 for dhcp [Music] when you assign a static ip address there are certain addresses to avoid for preventing conflicts first don't use an ip address that ends in dot 255 since this is reserved for a broadcast address in this example that would be 192.168.1.255. second don't use an ip address that ends in dot zero because those are normally reserved for networks third don't use an address ending with dot one or dot 254 since these are common default device ip addresses not only that but since the first and last available ip address are so common hackers often try them first when trying to access your network last but not least you should avoid using this same or even an overlapping lan ip subnet while configuring a vpn between different sites this would be a situation when you would want to change one of the lan networks to one of the other options for private ippools a 10.0.0.8 network or a 172.16.0.0.12 network all right now that you know some best practices for static ip addressing i'll log into some equipment to show you how to assign a static ip address on a cisco business device for this first example i'll use a cisco rv 340 router the first thing to do when you log into the rv340 web user interface is to open the lan option and then choose vlan settings there's already an ip address assigned to vlan 1. this screen provides options to add or edit a static ip address to do this select the add icon or the edit icon to edit an existing vlan in this case you can edit the ip address shown here so first you need to select the check box on the same line as the ip address and then click the edit icon here notice that when you click the edit icon all of the available fields that can be changed are shown here you can edit the ip address under ipv4 or even select the subnet mask and choose a dhcp type in this example i'll enter 192.168.1.2 the dhcp pool will be populated automatically once you enable the dhcp server you can change these if needed next be sure to click on the apply button to save the changes the static ip address on the vlan interface is set this process is similar for a cisco business access point i'll walk you through that process next first log into the access point user interface using your credentials navigate to wireless settings and select access points click on the edit icon click yes to continue as you can see the ipconfiguration type is set to obtain from dhcp from the drop down menu select static ip in this example i added a static ip address of 192.168.1.3 enter your preferred static ip address subnet mask and default gateway address which is the router that connects to the internet click apply to save the changes to assign a static ip address on a cisco business switch log in navigate to the ipv4 configuration settings and select the ipv4 interface option click the plus icon to add an ip interface select a vlan from the drop down menu and then choose the ip address type as a static ip after that all you need to do is enter the ip address and the network mask in this example i added an ip address of 192.168.1.4 and a network mask of 255.255.255.0 the settings are finalized click the apply button to save your changes keep these best practices in mind when setting static ip addresses because no matter what changes come your way it's good to know how to keep some things the same well at least in your network thanks for watching i'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "WebEx calling sometimes abbreviated as wxc integrates the normal Cloud PBX features that you'd expect such as phone functionality on hold music call transfers conference calling and more the WebEx infrastructure provides meetings conference room systems instant messaging Duo authentication and other beneficial features in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll show you how to convert an Enterprise phone to use Cisco's cloud-based voice over IP system WebEx calling once that side has been set up the steps in this video show the manual migration method that's recommended for a lab or small number of phones [Music] to start you'll need to make sure your model of phone and firmware version are eligible for conversion this list shows what will work see yours on this list great now there are two websites utilized for this process first is the WebEx control Hub located at admin.webex.com this is where you create an account enter information register the phone and manage the account once everything is configured before you migrate and register a phone your network administrator needs to set up your organization for WebEx calling including creating users and workspaces if you happen to be the network administrator and you need assistance with the configuration of WebEx calling like setting up phone numbers users hunt groups or anything other than provisioning the phone contact the WebEx calling support team for assistance the link is in the description the WebEx control Hub can be accessed once the account has been created the prerequisite list can be found under updates and migrations and then migrate Enterprise phones to MPP firmware the second website called the cloud upgrader is located at upgrade.cisco.com this site explains the prerequisites for the network administrator as well as a migration assistant that explains what to enter onto the phone itself these websites are listed in the description connect the Lan Port of the phone to your network typically a lan port on a router or switch if your phone uses power over ethernet use a Poes port on your switch optionally connect the access port of the phone to your computer with ethernet cables if your phone needs power besides with Poe connect the phone to an outlet log into wxc with an account that has administrator privileges navigate to calling and click the locations tab take note of the name of the location in my case this is site one the location name needs to be entered exactly the same when you fill out the template on a later step navigate to users you can see that the network administrator has some users already set up in this WebEx calling account although no phones are shown for migration scroll down under services and select updates and migrations select the second option for migrating Enterprise phones to MPP firmware once directed to this area you can see some of the migrations that have already been done there are two steps for doing the migration step one the prerequisites should have been done already so you can start with step two click on start a new task give this task a unique name I'll call mine migration test one select next download the CSV template I've already got those downloaded once you have them downloaded open the CSV file named devices this is a template enter the information including the location name you noted earlier delete the sample entries and save with a unique name that you'll remember I'll name mine 7861 wxc migration you can see in my example that I do not add an extension or a phone number my Mac address doesn't have colons and site 1 has been entered for the location on the upgrade page click upload select the CSV file for migration click open and then next eligibility will be checked for this phone once eligibility is displayed click on prepare for migration and then select ok at this point you will see the status as in progress it's important that you do not attempt to do anything to migrate the phone until it states it is ready otherwise you'll run into issues once the migration is ready go over to the Cisco Cloud upgrader website for these next steps choose Enterprise to MPP for WebEx calling only at this point you are at the Run migration step so select that since you are performing a manual migration select that option preferably for a lab proof of concept or if you only have a handful of devices scroll down for the instructions on your phone you need to go into the phone's settings the gear button on the phone select admin settings Network ethernet setup and then ipv4 setup scroll down to the alternate tftp tab by default this is set to no edit to set the alternate tftp to on yes and configure the tftp server 1 to the address listed enter the static IP address specified on upgrade.cisco.com it will show the latest information to enter these numbers you will either have a DOT button connected to the star key or you will need to click the large circular button on the phone for the octets to show for the address this depends on your model of phone once done select validate then apply if you are shown that a trust list is installed select erase wait for the phone to download the configuration it may restart several times once the migration process is complete the phone should be registered to the extension or phone number that was assigned to the user or Mac address in the CSV file [Music] when the line key is green it's registered with an extension that's it the phone has successfully migrated from Enterprise firmware over to MPP firmware for WebEx calling a few quick checks on our WebEx control Hub now that the phone's been migrated you may remember that there weren't any phones shown here earlier now when I navigate to devices that phone is listed and online this is the user that the phone was assigned to additionally if I go down to updates and migrations and select the migration that we just did you'll see there's no errors under the successful tab there's one entry and we can see that the user is online and this shows that the migration was successful [Music] all set you've completed the steps to migrate the firmware from an Enterprise phone to MPP for use with WebEx calling you can make calls on your phone both inside and outside of the office thanks for watching I'll see you next time",

    "transcript": "have you ever heard the saying many hands make light work how about Teamwork Makes the Dream Work essentially these popular sayings mean that when people join for a purpose more gets done as they're stronger together the same can be true for switches in a stack when they create a link aggregation group or leg a leg bundles individual links together combining them into one link between two devices this isn't done physically so you don't see it but the links will act as a single connection when links are joined logically there is increased bandwidth in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll give an overview of stacked link aggregation groups legs on Cisco business switches [Music] higher bandwidth is the biggest benefit of a leg because a larger volume of data can be sent over the connection a high data transfer rate leads to quicker download times allows multiple sites to be active simultaneously and supports multiple users when two units are connected to one another a stack leg is automatically assigned to the stack boards linking them per unit there can be up to two stack legs a stack leg can be composed of as little as two or as many as the maximum number of Stack ports depending on the unit type link aggregation control protocol lacp determines which candidate ports are active member ports the non-active candidate ports are on standby ready to replace any failing active member ports some of the possible States for stack ports are down this means the port operational status is down or that the stack Port operational status is up but traffic cannot pass on the port active this means the stack Port was added to a stack leg whose Port operational status is up and traffic can pass on the port it also means it is a member of a stack leg standby this means the stack Port operational status is up and bi-directional traffic can pass on the port but the port cannot be added to a stack leg and the port does not transmit traffic a possible reason for a port being on standby is if the stack ports with different speeds are used to connect a single neighbor this brings me to some physical constraints for stack legs that you should keep in mind a stacked leg must have ports that are at all the same speed only two stack legs can be active the remaining stack ports are in standby mode inactive when connecting a unit to a stack whose topology is not a ring or chain for example when connecting a unit to more than two neighboring units in a star topology the last area to review is the auto selection of Port speed in stacking when the cable is connected to a port the type of stacking cable is automatically discovered by default the system automatically identifies the stack cable type and selects the highest speed supported by the cable and the port when the cable type is not recognized a syslog message is displayed at the informational level there you have it the basics of legs working together for a more efficient network if you would like to see how stacking works on Cisco business series 350-4x switches click the link in the description thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "do you remember when the only way to talk on the phone was to be physically connected to a phone line in the wall in case you're too young to remember it was very restrictive unless you had a really really long phone chord after many advancements mobile phones came out giving people the option to make a call just about anywhere this can be compared to the accessibility of the internet when it first came out every device had to be connected to the internet with wires in order to work then Along Came the game changer Wi-Fi this allowed Wi-Fi enabled devices to connect to the internet without wires ah the freedom if you have ever wanted to know more about Wi-Fi stick around a while in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll introduce Wi-Fi including its definition benefits components and more next [Music] computers smartphones printers video cameras and wearables like smart watches all of these and more can connect to the internet using Wi-Fi a wireless networking technology Wi-Fi establishes a network by allowing these gadgets and many more to communicate with one another a Wi-Fi network is a wireless local area network WLAN that employs Wi-Fi protocols there are many Wi-Fi network benefits I'll start with the benefit of an extended range it makes Computing possible anywhere even with high data rates and sophisticated online applications this characteristic offers Comfort an improved user experience and the opportunity for New Uses and applications another benefit that Wi-Fi allows is scalability assigning login information is all that is necessary to add users to a Wi-Fi network keeping it simple there's no physical infrastructure left standing after users are removed as mentioned earlier Wi-Fi provides device flexibility since Wi-Fi enables the usage of a variety of devices including computers phones tablets gaming consoles and internet of things or iot devices Wi-Fi networks need a lot less Hardware than conventional networks so there is easier installation and maintenance this saves money speeds up installation and frees up more space for networking gear Network management is simplified with a Wi-Fi network Administration can be carried out virtually just like scaling with specialized software visibility user management Network Health monitoring data collection and optimization adjustments may all be made through a single interface embedded systems allow Wi-Fi installed equipment including iot devices with no interface a connection to the internet via a security standard called Wi-Fi protected setup WPS there are some Architectural Components that make up a Wi-Fi network that I'll go over starting with stations stations are components that wirelessly connect to the network each station has a distinct Network address that can either be an access point or an endpoint a basic service set BSS is a collection of stations with network connectivity when two or more wireless devices connect to one another in an ad hoc network without needing a router or access point the group is known as an independent BSS an extended service set ESS is a collection of bss's that are linked together such as in a network with numerous access points a distribution system is a means of connecting access points within an ESS these connections are either wired or Wireless a wireless distribution system WDS may use mesh or its own WDS protocol fixed Wireless is a special form of radio transmission used to connect geographically separated access points an access point is a base station that acts as a hub to which other stations connect access is the station's access to the network ESS allows access points to be connected via ethernet cables or wirelessly bridges are used to connect wlans to lands or access points an endpoint is any end user station a computer a mobile device printer or iot device you may have wondered how Wi-Fi works like broadcast media Wi-Fi carries information over radio waves data is sent in packets containing layers with labels and instructions these instructions along with unique media access control Mac address assigned to the endpoint allow packets to be routed to their intended destination Wi-Fi standards are constantly evolving but each subsequent upgrade is designed to be backward compatible with previous versions security is important especially on a network the most basic way to secure your Wi-Fi is to use Mac addresses to ban unauthorized stations however determined adversaries can join the network by forging an allowed address therefore encryption is the most popular way to secure Wi-Fi several encryption methods have been introduced such as those used in wired equivalent privacy WEP and Wi-Fi protected access WPA ask for authentication WPA2 and wpa3 are currently the standard authentication methods they provide acceptable security when strong passwords are used wrapping up one last thing I wanted to go over is mesh as an option for a Wi-Fi network a mesh Network uses many access points wirelessly connected to each other this extends the range and performance of a Wi-Fi network mesh networks offer multiple possible transmission paths and can use intelligent routing algorithms to manage routing and optimize performance mesh networks help solve the challenge of providing Wi-Fi in large public spaces such as libraries convention Halls stadiums and campuses [Music] there you have it answers to questions you may have had about Wi-Fi connection options keep improving I can't wait to see what's next for watching I'll see you next

Cisco RV series routers have a default IP address of 192.168.1.1 to check the IP address assigned to your system open a command prompt type ipconfig and press enter in this example my system ethernet adapter is configured with one IP address 192.168.1.90 this is in the correct subnet to verify the reachability of the Switch I'll ping its IP address 192.168.1.254. I'm getting responses so there's connectivity great everything is ready for access to the web UI of the switch to do this open a web browser I'll use Firefox type the IP address of the switch and press enter by default the browser will try to access the switch via http to access the switch via https click on the secure browsing https button you may get a warning message that shows a potential security risk ahead click on Advanced to see more details about that warning it's showing that 192.168.1.254 uses an invalid security certificate the certificate is not trusted because it is self-signed by default Cisco business devices have a self-signed certificate installed in this case the browser is not trusting that certificate there are two options to fix this warning the first is to add an exception on this browser to bypass the certificate warning to add an exception on the browser to bypass this warning navigate to settings and type certificate in the search box now select view certificates on the certificate manager window make sure that servers is selected click on the add exception option in the location box enter https colon forward slash forward slash and the IP address of the switch 192.168.1.254 select get certificate and the confirm security exception option it's showing the lifetime of that exception as permanent leave that as it stands and click ok close the browser reopen it and type in the IP address of the switch press the enter button again the browser tries to connect the switch via http select secure browsing https since you already added the exception on this browser to access the switch IP via https you should no longer get that certificate error enter the username and password and click login to access the switch the second option to eliminate the certificate warning is to obtain and install a root certificate in this system the required certificate needs to be installed on The Cisco business device this is done using its web UI in this example I've connected to my Cisco Business Wireless cbw setup via my wireless adapter you can see the IP address of the wireless interface by using the ipconfig command it's showing the private IP address configured on my wireless LAN adapter my cbw setup is configured in that IP pool access the cbw web UI open a browser I'll use Microsoft Edge type the URL https colon forward slash forward slash Cisco business dot Cisco and press enter via this URL I can access my cbw access point I have one installed certificate on the cbw device as well as one root certificate on my computer that's the reason I'm not getting a certificate warning when I access my cbw deployment I can see the connection is secure from a notification on the browser click the lock icon on the address bar now you can click on the login button enter the username and password configured on your cbw setup and click sign in now you can access the CDW web UI once you're logged into the web UI of a device you can do configurations or make changes as needed you are in control thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

I'll give it the name marketing to exit from this specific VLAN interface configuration mode I'll enter the exit command The Prompt is back in global configuration mode to configure a range of vlans in this option enter the command interface range VLAN 13-16 the v in VLAN needs to be capitalized you can enter the VLAN IDs without a space if you choose now I'm in the VLAN interface configuration mode for the vlans 13 through 16. you may log into another VLAN interface from here or create another range of vlans here I'm adding VLAN 17 through 19. I will add the space after the VLAN keyword to show that adding a space here is also acceptable enter the command end when you are done creating vlans and want to go back to privilege exec mode once you have all your vlans created enter one last command of copy running Dash config startup Dash config this saves all the new configurations there you have it it's for configure work using C C thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "most people know that IP addresses exist but have you ever wondered what makes up an IP address in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll explain ipv4 addresses for beginners ipv4 ipv4 addresses uniquely identify a device on an IP network they are 32 bits in length and are typically displayed in a format known as dotted decimal the 32 binary bits are divided into a network portion and a host portion they are broken into four octets each separated with a DOT each octet contains eight bits 192.168.15.1 is an ipv4 address in dotted decimal format 255 in the last octet can signal a broadcast address no octet can go higher than 255. ipv4 addresses can be converted to binary binary is a system where numbers and values for each bit are expressed as zeros and ones on the screen you can see the dotted decimal example and how it looks when it is written out in binary in the early years of networking every device that accessed the internet had a unique routable public IP address the addresses were running out too quickly though so a new plan was put into place two different classifications of ipv4 addresses public and private groups of private IP addresses were set aside for any home or business to use since they're private they don't have to be unique to everyone just unique within your home or business this is called your local area network plan public IP addresses are used to uniquely identify a device on the internet so you will need a public IP address to reach through the internet some companies pay for exclusive rights to a public IP address and attach it to a domain name like software.cisco.com or google.com this makes their website consistently reachable luckily if you don't need a permanent public IP address you can just be assigned a temporary one it may change over time but there is no cost besides paying your internet service provider for access to the internet a process called Network address translation that is used to keep everything flowing I won't dig into Nat in this video but if you want more information follow the link in the description with ipv4 there are five classes of IP addresses from class A to class E since classes D and E are reserved for other purposes you will use class a b or c for your land each of these provides a predetermined range of possible Network and host addresses for devices in the land to communicate they need to be in the same network Class A networks use a 10.x.x.x pattern the network portion is the first octet of the IP address the 10. the last three octets represent the host portion Class B networks on a lan use 172.16.x.x to 172.31.x.x Class C is a 192.168.x.xnetwork addresses use a 192.168.x.x pattern Class C is commonly used for smaller size networks by default Cisco routers typically come with the Lan address of 192.168.1.1 [Music] Cisco switches usually come with the default address of 192.168.1.254. each of these networks has a corresponding subnet mask a subnet mask is also a set of numbers with four octets it represents the size and range of IP addresses within a subnet on your land you can have addresses get automatically assigned by using a dynamic host control protocol the DHCP server you can assign them statically yourself or you can do a combination the most common devices that have static IP addresses set are servers routers and printers this is done for consistent reachability depends on your needs just make sure each IP address is unique within the Lan if you use a DHCP server you can assign a pool of addresses it can use and then the other IP addresses can be used for manual assignment there you have it some basic knowledge about ipv4 addressing and how it can work for you thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music] foreign [Music]",

    "transcript": "in computer networking a subnet refers to splitting a single Network into multiple smaller networks to illustrate the concept I'll compare a network with many devices to a town with many houses each house has its own unique address just like every device has its own unique IP address the town is split up into subdivisions the subdivisions are still part of the town but they probably have some characteristics that are unique there may be special rules that have to be followed there may be specified services that are provided based on the members that live there and information specific to that subdivision will be sent out just to them and not everyone in town the subdivisions in the town are like subnets on a network there are times when it's helpful to divide a big Network into smaller networks in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll explain subnets and how they work next [Music] why segment your network into subnets subnets are an efficient use of IP addresses they manage Network traffic more effectively broadcast traffic that is relevant to one subnet only needs to be sent to that subnet subnets also provide the benefit of security creating barriers between different sections of your network devices in separate subnets won't be able to communicate with each other unfortunately nothing is perfect subnetting can get complicated to configure or adjust now with every subnet there needs to be a specified subnet mask the subnet mask distinguishes the portion of the IP address that is the network portion as well as for hosts there are two ways to represent a subnet mask in dotted decimal notation or with a slash so so in a /24 network the first 24 bits the first three octets of the IP address should all be the same since the subnet mask shows 255 for each that designates the network portion the zero in the last octet shows the host portion for a long time all networks were either a sl8 sl16 or sl24 these were called classful networks when a network didn't require all the addresses the rest went to waste about 30 years ago classless interdomain routing cidr was introduced and subnetting became an option this game changer allowed you to create subnets of different sizes helping conserve IP addresses and provide more efficient routing you can create subnets for class A through Class C networks for Class C this is a table of the subnet options notice how how the subnet mask changes in dotted decimal and slash notations as more subnets are added as you add sub networks the number of hosts available for each Network goes down on a side note a slash 31 is only used in point-to-point links for this topology I have a wireless router a switch and three endpoint devices or hosts I'm using a Class C network of 192.168 8.1.0 with a subnet mass of 255.255.255.0 which can also be represented as a /24 the wireless router switch and pc1 are part of this same IP subnet so they'll be able to communicate with each other however laptop 1 will not be able to communicate with the other devices as it belongs to a different network address the three in the third octad shows that PC2 will not be able to communicate with the switch as they are in different IP subnet if you want to enable communication between laptop 1 and the rest of the network you simply need to change its Network address change the IP address of laptop 1 to 192.168.1.0 with a /24 and that's all there is to it for PC2 you simply change the subnet mask to /24 and you're set after these changes both laptop 1 and PC2 can communicate across the network having control over your network can be powerful now you know what subnets are and how they can work for you thanks for watching I'll see you next [Music] time",

    "transcript": "welcome to part two in the first episode I gave an overview and explained some advantages of using the command line interface CLI with Cisco small business switches in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll explain more basics of CLI including the command modes privilege levels and context sensitive help [Music] next there's a lot to cover so I'll Jump Right In by explaining command modes I'll start by entering the username and password for privilege level one user exec mode user exec mode lets you see configurations View files see the current software version and perform other basic commands user mode is indicated by a greater than symbol after the host name although user mode doesn't provide the power to make changes show commands provide crucial information on the status and configuration details of the network they're often used for troubleshooting and monitoring when you make changes you can check to make sure they've been applied with a show command privileged exec or administrative mode level 15 allows access to everything including big changes to the network this includes installing new software or altering systems settings to elevate from user mode to privilege mode enter the command enable then enter the password usually privileged exact mode is indicated by a hashtag symbol after the host name alternatively you can jump right into privileged exact mode by entering the level 15 username and password as shown here the hashtag verifies it when you have privileged exec access you can enter commands to get you to any of the configuration modes each command mode gives you access to a different set of commands and functionalities allowing you to perform specific tasks and configure particular aspects of the system to move from privileged access mode to Global configuration mode use the configure terminal command once this command is entered you will see the prompt change to show the word config in parentheses before the hashtag this confirms that you are in global configuration mode here you can make General changes to the running configuration of the switch if you want to make changes to a specific interface or line you need to First access Global configuration mode and then the interface or line mode these are sub modes for example I'll enter interface gigabit Ethernet 1/06 this puts me in the sub mode of interface configuration for that Port from there you can even enter a Sub sub mode I won't go into the details for this but I do want to mention that the mode you are in is always reflected in the prompt so if you aren't sure which command mode you are in check that out no matter what mode you go into you can back out one mode at a time with the exit command if you want to back out to privileged exec mode right away enter the end command since the CLI commands available depend on the mode you are in and there can be hundreds of different commands available it can be difficult to remember them all that's where Contex sensitive help comes in a question mark is a powerful help command there are a few ways that a question mark can be used if you simply enter a question mark the CLI will display a list of all commands that that are available in the current mode if you know the first word or words of a command you can type them add a space and then a question mark to see what options show for example you could enter show a space and then a question mark to see a list of all the possible show commands if you know a command starts with a certain letter or letters you can type them and add a question mark without a space with this help the CLI will display available command words in that mode that start the same way when reading the list of options as a result of a question mark you may see the letters CR between a less than and a greater than symbol this stands for carriage return that option is to indicate that you could simply hit the enter key to execute the command without adding any additional keywords an important step to always always remember is that once you have configuration set you need to save the changes to do this use the command copy running-config startup-config in privileged exec mode confirm with a Y to complete the save now you know the very basics of how CLI works you know the modes and how to navigate through them as well as how to get some help along the way in the last video of this series I'll share some shortcuts and tips to help make everything run efficiently the link is in the description thanks for watching I'll see you [Music] soon",

    "transcript": "switches make sure traffic is managed and directed efficiently in a local network they support high bandwidth and low latency making them ideal for environments that require fast and reliable data communication When selecting a switch there are many key factors to consider the number of ports the speed of the ports power over ethernet capabilities and so much more a good place to start is to decide if you want a layer two switch for simple network connectivity or a layer 3 switch with Advanced routing capabilities in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll explain the differences between layer 2 and layer three switches next both layer 2 and layer three switches manage the flow and prevent collisions efficiently handle ing traffic within the local network the fundamental difference is how they forward frames layer 2 switches use Mac addresses to forward frames within the same network they help handle data efficiently reduce Network congestion are coste effective and can be simple to deploy layer three switches have the capabilities of both a layer to switch and a router but instead of Mac addresses they use IP addresses to to forward frames this lets them route packets within the same network in between different networks in addition many layer 3 switches offer Advanced features that aren't available on a layer 2 switch many come with Advanced security features such as Access Control lists to control and filter traffic based on IP addresses protocols and ports these enhance network security by providing more granular control over data flow they can often make routing decisions faster than traditional routers because they're optimized for high-speed data processing most offer quality of service features for the prioritization of critical Network traffic this is important if your company uses applications that require high bandwidth and low latency like Voiceover IP or video conferencing some even support Advanced routing protocols providing failover capabilities in case of device or link failures so in a nutshell a layer 3 switch is more powerful and offers more features than a layer 2 switch When comparing switches typically a switch with a higher model number will have more features and advanced options but will cost more and may be more complex to set up it's a good idea to check each model to see which one fits your needs and budget best if you have a small Network you might want a sis business 110 unmanaged switch these layer 2 switches are not configured and are essentially plug-and playay some models in this series have power over ethernet ports so you can easily add and power devices to your network like IP cameras phones and wireless access points the CBS 220 smart switches are also layer 2 A step above the 110 they have some configuration options including some support for vlans Cisco business 250 smart switches are layer three switches that provide static routing they are designed to be cost effective while still offering essential features like VLAN segmentation and intervlan communication a step up from there is the CBS 350 managed switches these offer a higher level of control than the 250 with custom configurations Remote Management and advanced features like vlans Port security authentication and traffic prioritization there are also some stacking options within this series Cisco Catalyst 1200 switches provide layer three static routing capabilities they can manage internal routing within a network by directing traffic between different VLS using statically configured routes without the need for a dedicated router for basic Network segmentation Catalyst 1300 series switches provide Dynamic layer 3 routing allowing for efficient intervalent communication without degrading application performance they're designed to handle high bandwidth applications and Technologies wow there are so many options for managing data traffic which features are essential for your business now and in the future well luckily that's up to you thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "welcome back in this second of a two-part episode of Cisco tech talk I'll show you how to configure static routes on a router and a layer 3 switch next for this demonstration I've set up a specific Network topology it includes layer 3 switches which means they are routing capable the switches are connected over VLAN 100 using access ports this configuration allows vlans with identical names to exist on both switches without causing any conflicts for instance both switches can have a VLAN one assigned to different subnets and since there is no trunk link between the switches there's no conflict to demonstrate static routing I have connected my PC labeled PC3 to an access port that is a member of VLAN 15 on layer 3 switch I've assigned a static IP address to my PC which resides within the subnet of VLAN 15 from PC3 I can easily access PC2 which is in VLAN 25 I can verify connectivity by sending icmp requests to a device in vlan25 and receiving responses however pinging pc1 in VLAN 20 presents a different situation PC 1 is connected to switch a and there is no direct layer 2 or layer 3 communication path to it attempting to Ping pc1 will show no connectivity to establish this connectivity we need to create static routes first I'll connect to switch B to create a static route I will show that both switches are interconnected through VLAN 100 over access ports which are Port one on each switch in the ipv4 configuration I will set a static route indicating that to access network 10.20 20.0 sl24 packets must be directed to the next hop which is the IP address of layer 3 switch a after applying the static route it's crucial to note that although switch B can now direct packets correctly switch a still won't be able to Route the return icmp replies because it has no route to the network of PC3 to address this I'll connect to switch a via a console cable and create the necessary static route using the command line interface CLI after entering the global configuration mode on switch a I'll use the command IP route to create a static route if I want to reach Network 10.15.1 15.24 I must direct the packets to switch B which has the IP address 10.1 100.1 100.2 to confirm that the static route has been added I'll type show IP route and observe that the static route is present in the routing table now consider accessing the internet here the default route becomes critical as it usually provides access to the public network or the internet to illustrate this I'll change the configuration slightly by adding a connection through VLAN 1 to a router which will provide internet access and the default route the default route is usually indicated by 0.0.0.0 sl0 in the routing table this route can be obtained either statically through manual configuration or dynamically from a DHCP server connecting the switch to the router will result in the switch receiving an IP address for VLAN 1 from the DHCP server refreshing the static routes will display the default route provided by the DHCP server it's important to note that by default the router will only provide internet access to clients in VLAN 1 to extend internet access to other networks such as VLAN 15 an additional static route must be added to the router to ensure return internet packets can find their way back to the correct network if you log into the router and navigate to the static routing section you can see the static route that has been been created for Network VLAN 15 without this static route the router would not know how to route return packets from the internet to manually create a default route on switch a the following configuration command would be used IP route 0.0.0.0 to match any destination Network address then 0.0.0.0 to match any subnet mask the last IP address is the the next hop address that the packet should be sent to on its way to the Final Destination usually a router that's all there is to it now you can configure static routes using the web user interface or via CLI thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "The domain name system DNS is like the internet's phone book. When an easily remembered website like cisco.com is entered into a browser, it looks up its corresponding unique IP address and changes the search to that address. This is necessary for devices to communicate with other devices on the internet. Most businesses use the default DNS servers that come with their internet service provider ISP for this. However, there are public DNS servers you can use instead, which can provide some good benefits. In this first of a two-part episode of Cisco Tech Talk, I'll explain some benefits of using a public DNS server and show you how to change it on some individual devices. Next, [Music] Public DNS servers are managed by thirdparty companies and are open for anyone to use. They can be a good alternative. Public DNS servers often load websites faster, have better uptime and fewer outages, and may even provide additional security and privacy. Some of the most popular are Google DNS, Open DNS and Cloudflare. They provide both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. You can change the DNS server on different devices. Where you change the DNS settings depends on how widely you want the changes to apply and how much control you need. I will demonstrate the process on a few different devices. To keep it simple, I will use Google DNS for all of them. You can set a Windows computer to use a public DNS server with a few simple steps. Open the control panel on your computer. Select network and internet and then network connections. Doubleclick on your connection. Click properties. I'll select the IPv4 option. Enter the DNS server addresses you prefer. I'll enter 8.8. 8.8.8 as the preferred DNS server and 8.8.4.4 as the alternate. This setting applies to this one computer. You can also change your cell phone to use a public DNS server. To set this up on an iPhone iOS version 17, open settings, select the wireless network, and click the I next to the network name. Scroll down and select configure DNS. Choose manual. Delete the existing DNS server address and enter the public DNS server addresses. Click save in the top right corner of the screen. To change the DNS settings on an Android version 14, start by scrolling down the menu and selecting Wi-Fi. Choose the SSID that you're connected to. Click on settings, then view more options. If you are using DHCP, like in this example, you can't change the DNS settings. Switch this over to static. Keep this same IP address as before and ensure the gateway remains unchanged. For DNS, I'll switch to the public DNS server and then click save to apply the changes. Depending on your device and software version, these new settings may not transfer when you connect to a new wireless network. If they don't, you'll need to repeat the steps to apply when using this new network. That's all there is to it. With just a few steps, you can enjoy the benefits of using a public DNS server for your device. For a bigger impact, you can set your router so all devices using that router will use the public DNS server. I'll cover that in part two. The link is in the description. Thanks for watching. I'll see you soon. [Music]",

    "transcript": "Welcome back. In part one, I explained the benefits of using a public DNS server and how to change it on an individual device. By changing the DNS at the router level, you ensure that every device on your network benefits from the potentially faster, more reliable, and secure public DNS servers. In this episode of Cisco Tech Talk, I'll show you how to change DNS servers on an RV 160 wireless ACVPN router. Next, [Music] to change your RV 160 router to use a public DNS, start by accessing the router's web interface. If you know your router's IP address, open a browser and type it in. If you're unsure of the IP address, you can find it by going to the command prompt on your computer. Type ipconfig/all on Windows or if config on Mac or Linux. You can often look for the default gateway under your Ethernet adapter. Common IP addresses for routers are 192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1 0.1 or 10.0.0.1. However, it is important to note that in some scenarios, the default gateway on the PC will point to another device. If you use a router from your service provider, the IP address may be printed on the router itself or the manual that came with it. Once you have the IP address, enter it into your browser's address bar. You'll be prompted to log in with your username and password. After logging in, look for the DNS settings on the interface which are located on the main page for this model. This is for the WAN interface. The DNS server option will be available under the WAN settings page. Currently, you're most likely using the DNS provided by your internet service provider. To change it, select the use DNS as below checkbox and enter the new address. For Google's public DNS server, that's 8.8.8.8. For a secondary DNS, enter 8.8.4.4. Click the apply button to save the changes to the running configuration file. To save the changes on the startup configuration file, click the red save icon at the top of the page. Restart the router to verify that the changes took effect. Under the administration menu, the reboot option will be available. Click reboot. Select reboot the device. Click reboot and confirm by clicking okay. The router will restart, so you'll need to wait a few moments. Once the router is back online, log in again to confirm that the DNS changes have been applied successfully. Now your router should be using the new public DNS server settings. There you have it. Now devices such as computers, smartphones, smart devices, and printers connected to the network will automatically use the new DNS settings. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time. [Music]",
