Active routers advertise their routes to others; passive routers listen and update their routes based on advertisements, but do not advertise. Typically, routers run RIP in active mode, while hosts use passive mode. For additional support information, visit the Cisco Small Business Support Community: http://cs.co/9002DF7ts.",

    "description": "Setting up your office with devices like IP phones, wireless access points, and security cameras can get messy with all those cables and power sources. But what if you could simplify it all? In this edition of Cisco Tech Talk, we\u2019ll explain the basics of Power over Ethernet (PoE). \n\nKey advantages of PoE: \nEase of Use: Simplifies setup by dealing with only one type of cable. Place devices like IP phones, wireless access points, and security cameras wherever needed, regardless of electrical outlets. \nCentralized Power Management: Control power to all your PoE devices from one central location, allowing you to easily reboot devices, turn them on or off, or adjust power consumption. This can lead to significant energy savings. \nEnhanced Safety: PoE systems intelligently manage power delivery, ensuring each device gets the right amount without risk of overload or damage. \nSay goodbye to tangled cables! PoE is the streamlined solution you need for a more efficient and manageable network setup. \n\nRelated links:  \nCisco Small and Medium Business Overview\u2192 https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/solutions/small-business/index.html?dtid=osclytb001772&ccid=cc007478  \nCisco Small Business Product Support \u2192 https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/smb/product-support/small-business.html?dtid=osclytb001772&ccid=cc007478 \n\nDiscover how Cisco is transforming industries with cutting-edge technology and business-driven innovation. \n\nLearn more: \nCisco Official Site \u2192  https://www.cisco.com/?dtid=osclytb001772&ccid=cc007478  \nCisco Products & Services \u2192 https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/index.html?dtid=osclytb001772&ccid=cc007478  \nCisco Solutions \u2192  https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/index.html?dtid=osclytb001772&ccid=cc007478  \nContact Us \u2192 https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/about/contact-cisco/index.html?dtid=osclytb001772&ccid=cc007478  \n\nFollow Us on Social Media: \nCisco LinkedIn \u2192 https://www.linkedin.com/company/cisco \nCisco Twitter \u2192 https://twitter.com/Cisco \nCisco Instagram \u2192 https://www.instagram.com/cisco \nCisco Facebook \u2192 https://www.facebook.com/Cisco \n\nGot questions or insights?
