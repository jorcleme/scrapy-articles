To learn more about content filtering, please see the content filter on RV0 series routers video on the Cisco YouTube Small Business playlist. We will demonstrate a content filtering scenario on an RV082VPN router with firmware version 4.2.2.08. In this scenario, a small business wants to block access to Facebook on their network during business hours, which are from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday. In the forbidden domains list, the domain www.fas facebook.com has been added. In the blocked keywords list, the words Facebook, face, and book have been added. In the scheduling section, the blocking interval has been set from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on weekdays. When an employee attempts to access www.fas.com, a URL blocked message appears on the screen. Should an employee attempt to work around this domain blocking by using an alternative form of the URL such as m.fas.com, the page will also be blocked because of the domain contains keywords that are on the keyword blocking list.

rv042g and rv082 routers support a dual Wan feature that allows both Wan ports to be used at the same time the Dual Wan connections can also be configured as a failover to ensure continuous internet connectivity these routers also use protocol binding to further optimize the Dual Wan configuration protocol binding allows certain traffic to be sent through a specific Wan Port this video tutorial explains how to configure dual Wan settings on the rv042 rv082 and rv042g VPN routers to demonstrate this process we will use a rv082 router with firmware version 42.280206 connection to the internet port on the router next plug another ethernet cable into the DMZ interet port on the router by default the secondary Wan Port is configured as a secondary ISP W Port this port can also be configured as a DMZ log into the web Configuration utility from the system summary page click system management dual Wan click the appropriate radio button to choose a Wan load balancing feature the smart link backup feature ensures continuous Wan connectivity on the router in this mode a backup W Port will take over if the primary one fails if you want to use this feature choose the desired primary Wan Port from the drop- down list the load balance option uses both Wan connections at the same time this option increases the available bandwidth of the router click save to save the settings to edit the Dual van settings of a port click the configuration button in the WAN bandwidth area enter the maximum upload and download bandwidth in kilobits per second check with your internet service provider

    "transcript": "Hello everybody. My name is David Harper. I'm the product manager for the Cisco Find it network discovery utility. And over the next couple of minutes, I just want to show you how you can use Cisco Find it when installing new network equipment. Uh for the benefit of people who may not be familiar with Cisco Find it, it is a plugin for the web browser. You can see here we get this toolbar with um a few links here. If we click on the find it button here, we open up a sidebar and you can see I've got a network here with router, couple of switches, couple of wireless access points. Okay. And an analog telephone adapter. Okay. So, this is a brand new network. I've taken all the equipment out of the box, plugged it all together, and um what I can see here is find it has discovered everything in the network. It if I mouse over the device, I get a tool tip showing me information about the devices. So, what type of device it is, what firmware version it's running, what its MAC address is. If I um am having a problem and I need to log a case with the support center, I'll often get asked for the serial number. I can see the serial number directly from here. But uh probably more immediately useful is I can see what the IP address is. Okay. So I can uh double click on a device here and go straight to the web gooey and be able to log onto it without having to go and check DHCP tables and you know without having to log onto the router and look through the DHCP tables. Now the other thing that I can see here if I have a look is I've got these icons next to a couple of devices and what they're telling me is that there is a later firmware version available on cisco.com for these devices. Okay. So if I uh click on one of these devices now uh what find it will do is it goes away to cisco.com. It says there's a later version of firmware here. I accept the end user license agreement and it starts downloading that firmware to my PC. If I mouse over the device, I'll just accept that. If I mouse over the device, it'll tell me what that later firmware version is and what my current firmware version is. In this case, it's 1.062. The latest version available is 1.074. So, I've clicked on um the icon to start downloading. And you can see that that file is now downloading in the background. Uh now this wireless access point, the firmware downloaded rather quickly because I actually had downloaded before. If I click here, it opens up a folder. It shows me where the firmware is. And because that file was already present in this directory, what find it did was it just validated the check sum to make sure the file hadn't been corrupted. And since it was all in good shape, it um completed the transfer immediately. Now, what I can do is I'll just uh open up the access point, log into it quickly. Now that I've got that firmware, I haven't had to hunt through cisco.com to find the right firmware for the right device. Um I can just very easily grab that um update and apply it to the device. Okay. Now, while that upgrade's happening, if I go back to my switch, I can go in here. I can start doing configuration changes. Maybe in in this case, I'll just change the host name. Something simple. And when I apply that, you'll see in a moment that that host name change will take effect. See that switch now has the host name that I've configured. You can also see here where that access point that I'm upgrading, the entry here has gone red. That's because the access point has dropped off the network. Sometimes if you have a lot of devices in the sidebar and something drops off the network, you know, previously it was a little bit hard to see that there was something missing or that there was a problem. Now it's very obvious it's dropped off the network. If I mouse over it, I can see that um it's no longer on the network. It was last seen 38 seconds ago. So that gives me an idea of just how long it's been gone. Now when uh the upgrade finishes, which will take a couple of minutes, but when that upgrade finishes, that um entry will go back to black, you know, when the device is seen on the network, and I'll be able to see the new version has taken effect. Now, the other things I can do here, maybe if I'm having problems setting something up or I don't quite know uh what to do next, if I go into the support menu here, I can um find out how to get in touch with the support center, here's all the phone numbers for the support center if I need to log a case or possibly I just want to go to the support community where I can hunt through the knowledge bases there and find more information about specific products or uh you know, problems that other people have had in the past and what the solution was. So, I can go there. Finally, if um you know, I don't want to speak to somebody, but I I I would like to talk to a live person, I can always uh go to the online chat um and have a chat session with a um uh support center engineer. Okay. Uh so, that's about it. I'm just there's just a couple of quick things that you can use Cisco Find It for to help you uh when you're installing a network. It just makes the process go a little more smoothly and um hopefully saves you a bit of time and a little bit of um effort.",

    "transcript": "Welcome to Cisco Small Business video on demand series. Today, an SG 500X series switch is getting a voice VLAN configuration with quality of service set, six ports for phones and data, a beefy 10 gig uplink port to connect to a core or distribution layer, passing both voice and data, bonus, a port configured for our lobby phone only. All this in under three minutes. Let's get started. My PC is connected to port 7 on the switch and I have statically assigned my address 192.1681.10. The switch is at its default IP address of 192.1681.254 and is pingable. I put the address into the web browser to connect to the switch. I have upgraded the firmware on the switch and changed the default password. But other than that, the switch is at default configuration. I will be working on a powerful but simple to configure SG500X48 port PoE switch. The firmware that I'm using is right there. We look at the default configuration. We see a default of VLAN one. It is the only VLAN that is configured on the switch. Checking our port VLAN membership, we see that all the ports are in a trunk state with VLAN one as untagged traffic. Over on our voice VLAN properties page, we set our voice VLAN to be 100 and our quality of service settings are here. All values available and we will accept the default values. A message appears letting us know that we will be advertising our voice VLAN, which is what we want. We have success. Over on the VLAN settings page, we see VLAN 100 has been statically created, but is in a disabled state. I have devices connected to ports, but there is VLAN 100 is not applied to any ports yet. Going to our portto VLAN page, we change our VLAN to 100 and click go to bring up the state of VLAN 100 on ports. We see it's all excluded. On the six ports that we are connecting our phones to, we tag VLAN 100. On our lobby phone, which is port 10, we will untag VLAN 100. And on our uplink port, we will tag it. Hit apply. And we have success. Again, checking the port VLAN membership page, we see that our six phones have VLAN 100 tagged. Our lobby phone was untagged and our uplink port is tagged for VLAN 100. Finally, we need to go over to the interface settings page and change the lobby phone port from a trunk to an access port, giving a basic level of security, only allowing a device connected to the port access the VLAN 100. Change it to access and click apply. And we are done. Six phones with PCs, one lobby phone, an uplink port configured, all with quality of service applied. Stop that timer. under 3 minutes. It's that easy. We see 100 is now enabled with the devices connected to those ports. Thank you for watching.",

    "transcript": "hello everyone thanks for joining my name is max harbin i'm with cisco small business pre-sales i'm going to be demonstrating for you today one of our exciting new patented features voice services discovery protocol in conjunction with uh smb features on our 200 300 and 500 series switches i'll be demonstrating for you uh network wide zero touch voice deployment so it happens kind of quick so this link i'm gonna do last so let's get in the lab and get started okay so here is our physical lab i put together some spa 504s 514s some 525s i have some 7900 series ip phones i connected a wap 371 this is the cca tool that's used to configure the uc and also i have well there's some other 7900 series i also connected pvc 2300 so we can demonstrate when the voice services discovery protocol propagates what it will and won't send the voice vlan to our competitor switches our uc and the rv 320 so there's our physical lab so let's get into the configuration all right so here we are at the config portion basically what i did i factory defaulted all the switches uh our competitors as well as ours and so we have nothing but vlan 1. so let's look at the 200 just vlan 1. the 300 just vlan 1 is there and down to the 500 is just vlan 1. like i said these are all just factory default settings on these just to kind of show you the purpose of how this is all going to work so we're going to look at the let's go to the voice vlan section notice we have the enable auto voice vlan and by external voice trigger that's the default settings and so let's look at our port vlan membership just to kind of show all the way down the line it's just vlan 1 as well on all of the switches so let's find that on here and then finally on the sg 500 so we're going to look at our vlan membership there so factory default nothing but vlan 1 across there so we need to get our voice vlan 100 propagated from our uc device down so what i'm going to do i'm going to connect the cable from ge8 to the expansion port on the uc 540 and once it did that there you notice that the the save started coming up indicating a change that is the voice vlan 100 being propagated it'll show you here it's set up as a static vlan on the 200 switch also let's go to the 300 and looks like it's propagating there and let's confirm that there it is and let's jump to the sg 500 and we're going to do the same so let's look at our vlans and there's voice vlan 100 so let's take a peek at our port vlan membership and we'll notice now on our access ports all the phones uh g1 7 and 10 as our access point notice uh ge2 there's 26 that's our uplink ge2 did not get it that's our pvc 2300 which is our camera that need voice so not gonna put it there i just put it there so you guys could see that for demonstration purposes that it will push where it's prevalent and it won't where it isn't so got all that set so let's jump back up to the 200. let's take a look at it support vlan membership looks like all the trunks are there oh ge2 is linked to our netgear so let me see if i can add a phone and do some manual config to get that up so here we go and we'll we'll come back to this a little bit later like i put in the annotation here and we'll show you how this is actually going to work and bring everything up so let me save this real quick and then we'll jump over to our competitor side and show you a little bit of what i had to go through for those now remember these were factory defaulted as well so starting fair on both ends so let's get logged in trying to do all the configs for these from the web gui side um i was able to do add vlan 100 here from the web gui and it is uh the voice vlan now but i was not able to find that in the web so added voice vlan to all the ports via this connection down here and then i actually had to go back into command line for the hp and define it as voice vlan so the qos the only option i really had here to choose was deferential services which kind of made the most sense for what we're doing i'm not sure that's right yet but on the d-link side here as well nothing automatic the vlan did not propagate so i had to go here and add it and add the voice vlan create it and enable it add it across all the ports here the voice vlan was not enabled i had to enable this here from the factory default that was disabled and so i had to make some changes on this end as well and then also go down and we'll look at the section about um the lldp med in a little bit but let me show you the netgear real quick um here's logged in i went into the vlan i was able to add oh looks like it's going to make me log in again bear with me okay here we go starting to come back up so on the switch side here when we were looking at this i added the voice vlan 100 and had some problems with the browser and i'll kind of explain all that here a little bit so defined the voice vlan went into the advanced section looked at the vlan membership and the drop down there for the vlan id but i had no means to add or tag across the port so after about 20 minutes of searching on your site he said i had to use an older browser so i pulled up an old opera and let me get that logged in here and then i'll show you how i added that to the access ports for this switch so back into switching into our vlan we're going to advanced our vlan membership now you see the ability to add that as tagged or untagged across so i'm going to choose our vlan 100 i'll go ahead and use our unit and this is where i had it tagged all the way across for ease sake back to the d-link here i wanted to show you as well like the global settings for it like on most of these the was all disabled so let's enable this real quick and apply it and by that time i hope this phone will come back up here on this d-link side and we'll see if we get that uh trunk to the 200 back up and everything talking so let's jump over to the 200 real quick and let's go back down to our port vlan membership and there we go on ge2 100 is there our vsdp in conjunction with our smart ports and everything recognized via the intelligence that it did need 100 on there because we do have a a voice endpoint requesting it once we created the manual path from the competitor switches so now let's look at it from a uc perspective here all the phones they're up and registered most voice engineers usually configure those prior but let's say they forgot one so we're gonna have to do one from scratch so let's go to users and phones and i just sent an engineer out for example let's say we sent them out with a factory defaulted phone of course we see here's the listing of the phones again that are configured and on the uc so we're going to send one out from a factory default state we're gonna connect that to i guess we'll go to the sg500 downstream but let me get some stuff set up here on the uc so we can see the communication we're gonna do a debug tftp packets and let's do debug tftp events and then we'll get started on that so let me click begin okay our debugging is running from the uc side so let's go to the switch like i said we're gonna do port two so let's look at it from the phone's perspective see in a few okay so here we are at the phone and we're gonna as factor defaulted this is a spa 525 g2 so i'm going to plug it into port 2 on the sg500 sorry about the shaky camera i'm trying to do this with one hand so all right we get that plugged in and let's go back to the phone so you can see what's going on there the phone is starting to power up and as it starts to power up it's gonna communicate to the uc to see if it's got the right config information get its ip address all that good stuff so the system is booting it's checking the ethernet that's good so it should be getting its ip there it goes now as it goes through it's going to look and see about its config notice there's no config because we just set this thing up so it's going to reboot itself it's going to come back up and let's see what state we're in so we're booting again ethernet and ip and so our next step if it's not it should upgrade let's see what it's doing yep it's pulling its config file down so the firmware version should be close to the same i wouldn't think that it'd have to do much so it's connecting registering there it says pre-sales lab of course it has no extension so see you back on the switch side and we'll see the rest later all right so now we're back at the sg 500 let me jump to the port vlan membership there we are ge2 added automatically didn't have to make any changes myself so let's jump to the uc let's hit end so we see the phone talking to the uc getting its information like normal like you would expect with everything configured as it needs to be so that's good and so just to finalize the rest of this up i'm going to go in real quick and let's refresh and update this we should see the phone actually here registered with no info there we go so i'm going to do an edit i'm going to add it send the rest of the config to it jump back to the phone and we'll conclude our video at that point so let me get the rest of this typed in pretty easy so far huh so looking at it from the cisco side been nothing really but uh plug and play for the most part and just uh the config on the call manager side and that's done but from a switch perspective the only thing i've done this whole lab is pointing cables plug in one cable for the cisco side not quite so much for the competitors but you know that's part of the process that's why we stand out so let's say okay to this get this going this is good we're okay there it is on the switch so one last time from the phone and then we'll be done okay guys now as you can see it's got extension 240 and it's uh ready to get up and dial out so bring it across we're done",

    "transcript": "[Music] hello and welcome to this episode of stocking Solutions labs and Demos in this video we'll go over how to configure chain and ring topologies on the sg550 XG and sg350 XG stackable switches please note however that the sg550 XG and sg350 XG cannot be linked in the same stack for all device is shown in this video we'll be using software version 2.1.0 46 let's get started [Music] a chain topology is a linear connection between all units via stacking links starting with one switch each unit connects to its neighboring switch through a single cable between their stack ports until the last unit has been linked with the one before it if a link between the two units fails the switch stack will be cut off where the fail occurs for this reason a chain topology is not very robust as it does not have full redundancy this is where ring topologies have an advantage in a ring topology all units in the stack are connected in a loop with the last unit connecting back to the first by connecting them in this way you provide additional redundancy in the case of a failed stack link as seen here the failure of one Link in a ring topology causes the stack to revert to a chain topology and maintains the Stack's functionality thus a ring topology is more reliable than a chain topology and allows for more stable stack operation let's show you how to physically set up each topology for this demonstration we'll be using four sg550 XG switches in a chain topology keep in mind that you can use any network port on the switch as a stack Port let's start by taking a cable and connecting the first and second switch together take note of the ports you connect to on each switch you'll need this information when designating stock ports lat here then take another cable and connect the second and third switch together repeat this process for every switch you want to include in your stack a ring topology uses the same configuration as a chain except the last unit connects back to the first therefore in order to make the stack a ring topology we just connect the last switch back to the first one now that we have physically established a ring topology we'll go over their configurations in the graphical user interface this is where we designate the appropriate ports for each unit that will be used to stack [Music] for each switch you'll need to log into the web Configuration utility to configure the stock ports start by logging into the first switch at the top of your stack and then click on Administration and then stack management the stack management page shows your current stock topology and designates which switch in your stack is the stack Master additionally it provides a visual stack topology view of your current stack since your stack ports haven't been configured yet each switch is designated as a the master of its own single unit chain topology under the unit View and stack Port configuration section you can simply click on the ports you want to designate as stacking ports for the switch these should be the same ports you use to connect your switches earlier note that in order to enable stacking at least two stacking ports must be selected in the graphically user interface by default there are no preconfigured stack ports on the switch you can designate two to four stacking ports in the SG 350 XG and two eight stacking ports on the sg550 XG in the unit ID after reset drop-down list choose Auto in order to automatically assign each stack member a unique unit ID the assignment process will be based on each unit's Mac address and determine the initial Master backup and slave units finally click apply and reboot to save your changes a confirmation window will open asking if you would like to continue click okay and your device will reboot now we simply need to configure the stock ports for the other three switches using the same procedure log into each switch's web Configuration utility navigate to Administration and then stock management and designate the appropriate ports we are using in the physical setup after the changes have been applied and all switches have finished rebooting the 4 unit stack will be established once we log into our stack master and navigate to Administration and stack management we can view new updated information on the stack under stack topology view all four units of the current ring topology appear and we can select each individual switch for stack configuration clicking on individual unit will show you which of its stacking ports are active and whether the unit is a master backup or slave within the topology a brief overview of your stack configuration can also be found in your master switches system summary if you click on status and statistics then system summary you can view the units in your stack as well as individual switch serial numbers and pvid numbers the sg350 XG and sg550 XG switches support stacking under two types of topologies ring and chain a ring topology is more favorable than a chain topology due to its additional redundancy however both topologies can be used to establish a functional stack to configure each topology you need to physically link ports between each switch and then designate those ports as stack ports in the graphical user interface this concludes our tutorial on ring and chain topologies for more information please please see the article below or check out the Cisco small business support Community for further assistance I'm Remy from Cisco and thanks for watching this episode of stacking

    "transcript": "STACKING IS A FEATURE AVAILABLE ON SELECT\nCISCO SMALL BUSINESS SWITCHES. TO UNDERSTAND THIS FEATURE AND ITS BENEFITS, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME BASIC STACKING CONCEPTS AND TERMS. FIRST, LET'S DEFINE WHAT A STACK IS. A STACK IS A NETWORK SOLUTION COMPOSED OF TWO OR MORE STACKABLE SWITCHES. SWITCHES THAT ARE PART OF A STACK BEHAVE AS ONE SINGLE DEVICE. AS A RESULT, A STACKING SOLUTION SHOWS THE CHARACTERISTICS AND FUNCTIONALITY OF A SINGLE SWITCH, WHILE HAVING AN INCREASED NUMBER OF PORTS. THIS ALLOWS USERS TO EXPAND THEIR NETWORK CAPACITY WITHOUT THE HASSLE OF MANAGING MULTIPLE DEVICES. ADDITIONALLY, SWITCHES CAN BE ADDED OR REMOVED FROM A STACK AS NEEDED WITHOUT AFFECTING THE OVERALL OPERATION OF THE STACK. DEPENDING ON ITS TOPOLOGY, A STACK CAN CONTINUE TO TRANSFER DATA EVEN IF A LINK OR UNIT WITHIN THE STACK FAILS. THIS MAKES STACKING AN EFFECTIVE, FLEXIBLE, AND SCALABLE SOLUTION TO EXPAND NETWORK CAPACITY. NOW THAT WE HAVE A GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT A STACK IS AND WHY YOU WOULD WANT TO CONSIDER A STACK FOR YOUR NETWORK, LET'S GO OVER SOME BASIC STACKNG TERMS THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW BEFORE SETTING ONE UP. FIRST, A STACK HAS A MASTER, OR COMMANDER. THE MASTER IS A SWITCH IN THE STACK THAT HANDLES THE CONFIGURATION FOR THE ENTIRE STACK. WHEN YOU WANT TO MANAGE YOUR STACK, THE MASTER UNIT IS THE DEVICE THAT YOU CONNECT TO IN ORDER TO MAKE CHANGES. THE MASTER ALSO HANDLES OTHER IMPORTANT STACK FUNCTIONS SUCH AS, DETECTING WHEN SWITCHES ENTER OR LEAVE THE STACK, AND UPGRADING OUTDATED SWITCHES. THE BACKUP IS A SWITCH THAT WILL BECOME THE NEW MASTER IF THE ORIGINAL MASTER GOES OFFLINE. IN THIS WAY, A BACKUP HELPS MAINTAIN THE RESILIENCY OF THE STACK. A SLAVE, OR MEMBER, SERVES AS AN ADDITIONAL UNIT WITHIN THE STACK. UNLIKE THE MASTER AND THE BACKUP UNITS, THE SLAVE DOES NOT SERVE AN ADDITIONAL FUNCTION WITHIN THE STACK OTHER THAN TO INCREASE PORT CAPACITY. AS A RESULT, IF THE MASTER AND BACKUP UNITS FAIL, THE STACK WILL BECOME DISABLED. FINALLY,\nA STACK PORT IS A PORT ON THE SWITCH THAT IS USED TO COMMUNICATE WITH OTHER SWITCHES IN THE STACK. DEPENDING ON THE MODEL, A SWITCH CAN HAVE EITHER PRECONFIGURED OR USER-DEFINED STACK PORTS. NOW THAT WE'VE GONE OVER THESE BASIC STACKING CONCEPTS AND TERMS, YOU'VE HOPEFULLY GAINED A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT A STACK IS AND HOW ONE WOULD FIT IN TO YOUR NETWORK.

FOR A STACK TO OPERATE, IT MUST HAVE A MASTER UNIT.\nTHIS SWITCH HANDLES THE CONFIGURATION OF THE ENTIRE STACK.\nIF THE MASTER UNIT SHOULD FAIL, ANOTHER UNIT MUST BE AVAILABLE TO SERVE AS\nTHE NEW STACK MASTER. THIS UNIT IS CALLED THE MASTER BACKUP.\nIN THIS VIDEO, WE WILL GO OVER STACK UNIT FAILURES\nAND THE RESULTING MASTER BACK UP PROCESSES. LET'S GET STARTED! WHEN SETTING UP A STACK OF FOUR SG550XG SWITCHES IN A RING TOPOLOGY,\nWE CAN SEE THAT UNIT 1 IS THE MASTER UNIT WITHIN THE STACK,\nUNIT 2 IS THE MASTER BACKUP, AND UNITS 3 AND 4 ARE THE SLAVE UNITS.\nIF ONE OF THE LINKS TO THE MASTER UNIT FAILS, THE UNIT WILL STILL SERVE AS THE STACK MASTER;\nHOWEVER, THE STACK WILL REVERT TO A CHAIN TOPOLOGY.\nIF THE MASTER UNIT IS DISCONNECTED FROM THE STACK AT ALL POINTS,\nTHE NEW STACK WILL CONTAIN ONLY UNITS 2, 3, AND 4,\nWITH UNIT 2 ASSUMING THE NEW MASTER ROLE.   THIS IS CALLED A SWITCHOVER, WHERE THE BACKUP UNIT TAKES OVER THE MASTER\nROLE AND MAINTAINS THE OPERATION OF THE STACK.\nIN ORDER FOR THE BACKUP TO BECOME THE MASTER, BOTH UNITS MUST MAINTAIN A WARM STANDBY AT\nALL TIMES. IN A WARM STANDBY, BOTH THE MASTER\nAND ITS BACKUP UNITS ARE SYNCHRONIZED WITH THE STATIC CONFIGURATION.\nWHEN THE BACKUP UNIT BECOMES THE MASTER, ALL OF ITS PROCESSES AND STACK PROTOCOLS ARE\nINITIALIZED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ENTIRE STACK.\nAS A RESULT, THERE IS TEMPORARILY NO TRAFFIC FORWARDED TO THIS UNIT. WHEN THE BACKUP UNIT BECOMES THE MASTER, THE INITIAL SLAVE UNITS REMAIN ACTIVE\nAND CONTINUE TO FORWARD PACKETS BASED ON THE CONFIGURATION\nFROM THE ORIGINAL MASTER. THIS MINIMIZES DATA TRAFFIC INTERRUPTION.\nONCE THE BACKUP UNIT HAS COMPLETED THE TRANSITION TO THE MASTER STATE,\nIT INDIVIDUALLY RESETS THE DEFAULT CONFIGURATION FOR EACH SLAVE.\nTHIS HELPS PREVENT CONFIGURATION ERRORS DURING THE SWITCHOVER. IF THE ORIGINAL MASTER UNIT IS RECONNECTED AFTER THE SWITCHOVER,\nTHE NEW MASTER, OR ORIGINAL BACKUP UNIT, REBOOTS AND BECOMES THE BACKUP ONCE AGAIN,\nWHILE THE ORIGINAL MASTER UNIT ASSUMES THE MASTER ROLE. THE MASTER BACKUP PROCESS IS AN EFFICIENT WAY FOR A STACK TO CONTINUE TO FUNCTION NORMALLY IN THE EVENT OF A UNIT OR LINK FAILURE.\nIF THE MASTER UNIT FAILS, THE BACKUP UNIT ASSUMES THE MASTER ROLE\nAND CONTINUES TO FUNCTION AS THE MASTER. THIS SWITCHOVER PREVENTS THE FAILURE OF THE\nMASTER FROM CAUSING THE ENTIRE STACK TO FAIL. THIS CONCLUDES OUR TUTORIAL ON MASTER BACKUP FOR THE SG550XG AND THE SG350XG SWITCHES.\nFOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE CHECK OUT THE CISCO SMALL BUSINESS SUPPORT COMMUNITY\nFOR ASSISTANCE.

    "transcript": "Hello, and welcome to this\nepisode of Stacking Solutions, Labs and Demos. Today, we'll be going over fast link failover\non the SG550XG and the SG350XG series managed switches. Fast link failover is a process\ndesigned to reduce the duration of data packet loss in case a link in a stack port fails.\nThis process is only supported in a ring topology because, in this set up, the stack can still\nremain operational even if a link fails. Suppose we have four units\nin a stack that are set up in a ring topology, where unit one can send traffic to unit two\nor unit four. If unit one is supposed to send traffic to unit three, the traffic can be\nrouted in two ways: unit one to unit two to unit three, or unit one to unit four to unit\nthree. Therefore, if the link between units one and two fails, unit one can send traffic\nto unit three via unit four, and vice versa. Until the stack topology is\nrecovered, the stack unit sends back the packets that are supposed to be sent through the failed\nstack port, transmitting the packets through the connected stack port all the way to the\ndesignated unit. Fast Link Failover is a feature\nthat helps minimize data packet loss when a link in a stack port fails. This concludes\nour tutorial on fast link failover for the SG550XG and the SG350XG switches.

    "transcript": "Hello, and welcome to this episode of stacking\nsolutions, labs, and demos. Today we'll be going over the auto-image update\nfeature available on the SG350XG and SG550XG series managed switches. Any switch in a stack must have the same firmware\nimage as the master in order for the stack to remain operational. With auto-image update, the stack can change\nthe firmware of any newly inserted device to keep it working with the rest of the stack. This is done by referring to the stack master's\ncurrently installed image, and comparing it to the new device. If the firmwares don't match, the image from\nthe master is copied over to the new switch and saved. For this tutorial, we'll be using a stack\nof SG550XG switches. Please note, however, that auto-image update\nalso works with a stack of SG350XG switches. To demonstrate this process, we will insert\na switch into a stack, designate the appropriate stack ports, and reboot the switch in order\nfor the changes to take place. Upon reboot, the software version check will\nbe performed. If differences in software versions are detected,\nthe auto-image update process will begin. When this process is initiated, notifications\nwill appear on the right side of the screen. Once the image transfer is completed, the\nswitch will reboot. Upon reboot, the device will be listed in\nthe new stack, along with its updated software version number. The auto-image update feature provides a simple\nand automated process for keeping all switches in a stack up to date. For more information, go to cisco.com or check\nout the Cisco small business support community for assistance.

Of course all of this \"digitalization\" puts\nmore demand on the IT admins and integrators who manage these systems. Life for them can seem like one big fire drill. This is where Cisco FindIT Network Management\ncomes in. Cisco's FindIT Network Management gives IT\nprofessionals an affordable way to deploy, configure, and monitor networks built on Cisco\n100 through 500 series switches, routers, and wireless access points. Most of the solutions available today either\nonly manage a single type of device, such as a router, or allow users to do basic monitoring\nof a set of individual devices. FindIT Network Management is designed to manage\nthe network as a single system, reducing the amount of time needed to maintain the network\nand increasing the system uptime. How does it work? Cisco FindIT Network Management is composed\nof two applications - the probe and the manager. The probe resides on the local network - one\nprobe per site. The manager can reside anywhere as long as\nthe probes can communicate with it. For networks with only a single site, the\nmanager is optional. When first deployed, the probe will discover\nall of the network, including the PC's, servers and mobile devices connected to the network. By getting port information from the switches\nand access points, FindIT is able to build a topology map showing how things are connected. You can connect to the probe's intuitive user\ninterface and see the network topology map, along with a list of networking devices, including\ntheir firmware versions, serial numbers, and other important information. Floor plans can be added to show the physical\nlocations of the networking equipment. Once installed the FindIT probe will send\nalert messages and track network utilization, number of clients on the network, and other\nkey statistics. From the FindIT probe user interface, the\nuser can also shut down ports, add new VLANs or wireless networks, and make other changes\nto the network. You can also back up the configuration files\nor install new firmware on every Cisco small business device on the network with a few\nclicks! If there are mutliple sites being managed,\nthe FindIT Manager will be the dashboard to see any critical alerts for any of the probes\nand be able to quickly get access to the selected site. The manager can also generate reports that\ncan be used in planning discussions with the business owner. With FindIT Network Management, IT professionals\ncan gain some sanity back in their lives. Being able to operate more efficiently, maintain\nhigher network uptime and proactively address potential problems, will make the IT professional's\nlife easier, and the end-user happier. Please check out our other videos to learn\nmore about FindIT Network Management. You can also go to www.cisco.com/go/findit\nfor more detailed information on cisco's FindIT Network Management.

We'll start by going over how to download\nCisco's AnyConnect VPN client and then discuss the SSL VPN configuration associated with\nthe RV340 and RV345. First, download the Cisco AnyConnnect VPN\nclient from the Cisco AnyConnect website. Next, run the installer to install the VPN\nclient. Connect to and log in to your device. From the homepage, click VPN, then SSL VPN. Under the General Configuration tab, you can\nconfigure both mandatory and optional gateway settings that relate to your SSL VPN server. Then, under the Group Policies tab, click\nAdd, Edit, or Delete to edit basic VPN information such as names, DNS settings, and WINS settings. For both of these tabs, click Apply to apply\nyour changes. An example configuration would be as follows:\ngo to the VPN tab and click the SSL VPN. Under the General Configuration tab, click\nthe On bubble next to \"Cisco SSL VPN Server.\" Next, leave all fields default, but set the\nClient Address Pool field to the IP address of the desired pool. This address pool should be preferably different\nthan any LAN DHCP ranges in your network. You may also wish to change the client domain\nand what's displayed on the login banner. click Apply when you are finished. Then, under the Group Policies tab, click\nAdd to add a new SSL VPN group table. Next, type in the desired policy name, secondary\nDNS, primary WINS, secondary WINS, and description. We'll leave IE Proxy settings disabled and\nthe Enable Split Tunneling box unchecked. Click Apply when finished. Now to connect, open up the AnyConnect Mobility\nClient and enter an IP which is reachable from the WAN to the router, followed by the\ndefault gateway port of 8443 set earlier. Click Connect. If you have user accounts set up you'll be\nprompted to enter a username and password to connect. The login banner is then displayed which must\nbe accepted to continue. There should now be an SSL VPN connection\nbetween your client device and the router. To quickly test this open up command prompt\nand check the connection between your computer and the internal LAN IP of the router. Type the command \"ping\" followed by the address. By default, this will be 192.168.1.1. If you receive reply packets, this confirms\na connection was successful. At this point, you should have all the information\nyou need to use AnyConnect for basic SSL VPN connections for your RV340 and RV345 routers. I'm Keshav from Cisco, and thanks for watching.",

As a network\nadministrator, you can probably relate because at the end of a full day of managing a bunch\nof individual devices, you feel like you've been on a giant treadmill and not really going\nanywhere. We'll talk about how to get more out of your day, next. You've been there,\nright? Spending a ton of time managing individual devices and trying to keep track of hardware,\nsoftware, and licensing. Enter Cisco's FindIT Network Management. FindIT gives you a single\npane of glass solution where you can manage your entire network as a single system to\ncut down on the time needed to maintain your network while increasing system uptime. FindIT\nwill automatically discover your network, and give you an affordable way to configure\nall supported Cisco 100 through 500 series switches, routers, and wireless access points.\nFindIT also sends you notifications about firmware updates and devices in your network\nthat are no longer under warranty or being supported. That way, you can be proactive,\nnot reactive. Let's break this down. FindIT has two applications: the probe and the\nmanager. The probe lives on the local network. And the manager can live anywhere as long\nas probes communicate with it. In the past, FindIT was deployed strictly as a virtual\nmachine. Now, you can install it on your own hardware! FindIT also acts as a Cisco Plug\nand Play server that lets you centrally manage firmware and configuration files for selected\ndevices. After the initial setup, configuration and firmware can be downloaded to a device\nautomatically. What about reporting? FindIT tracks 90 days worth of events. You'll get\na list of everything that happened in the network and you can filter the results to\nwhatever interests you. You can monitor network health and traffic, and even track any rogue\naccess points that might be slowing things down and posing a security risk. Upgrades\nhappen. You may be used to re-deploying a new virtual machine for every upgrade. With\nFindIT, you'll get automatic upgrades to the probe and manager software without having\nto re-deploy. Using Kaseya VSA? FindIT is so intuitive, it even has a plug-in to tie\nits functionality right into Kaseya so you can see your devices for remote monitoring\nand management. So think about it. No more treadmill. No more running in circles trying\nto manage your network. With FindIT, you'll be a lean, mean IT machine. Thanks for watching\nTech Talks from Cisco. We'll see you next time.  ",

    "transcript": "With Cisco's FindIT Network Management solution,\nyou can manage and monitor your entire network as a single system, which is a way better than\nmanaging a bunch of individual devices. But you know what else FindIT does? It can also be used to back up and restore\nyour devices. We'll talk about it, next. Let's get right into it. Here's how to backup and restore devices\nwith FindIT Network Manager 1.1. First, you'll need to login to the FindIT\nNetwork Manager using your credentials. Once you're in, the default view is this\nmap view. But let's go to the list view. Since the actual backup and restore processes\nare actually handled on the probe, you have to cross-launch into your selected probe. Click on the site name and a pane will open\non the right hand side. You'll see a globe. Click the globe and it will cross launch you\ninto that probe. The first page that comes up is the Discover\nTopology Map. In this example, you see a router, two access\npoints, and a switch. You also see three Voice Over IP phones. Normally, you'd have to log in to each device\ndirectly to back up their configurations. With FindIT, you can do an all-in-one backup. Go to Actions, then Backup Configurations. I'll just put a note here: Network Backup\nfrom FindIT 1.1, then click Save. Notice the little activity monitor up here\nin the Task Center. Click on that and you can see the status of\nwhat's happening. This shows the RV325 was a successful backup. The phones were not successful because they\ndon't have the ability to back up their configurations. And it looks like the other devices were successfully\nbacked up. You can now close that window. You can also just backup one device if you'd\nlike. Let's click on the switch. A side panel opens. Click on Actions, then Backup Configuration. Here you can actually do a backup of this\none device. We'll call this New Switch Backup. You'll see in the task window that it's\ncomplete. You'll also see it there under the entire\nnetwork backup we did. Now let's say someone was managing this\ndevice and made a mistake on the configuration and saved it. And let's say that misconfiguration was\ncausing issues. In that case, you can restore your device\nto a previous configuration. Once you click on the device, go to Actions,\nthen Restore Configuration. Select the backup configuration you wish to\nrestore. Then click Confirm. The Task Center will show that it's actively\nrestoring. Click on that and get the pop out window again\nso you can monitor the status of the job and see when it's restored. It's that easy. Backup and restore. Two more reasons FindIT Network Manager 1.1\nis THE best way to keep your IT process humming along. Thanks for watching Tech Talks from Cisco. We'll see you next time.",

With constant exposure to internet threats,\nbusinesses have to think about how to boost employee productivity and network performance\nby limiting unwanted network traffic. We\u2019ll talk about how, next. Small businesses are especially vulnerable\nto security threats. In fact, the National Cyber Security Alliance\nclaims that each year 20% of small businesses experience a cyber attack. And a cyber attack might just be serious enough\nto close a business down. With Cisco RV340-Series Security Routers,\nbusinesses can protect their network from unwanted content and malicious websites without\ncompromising the online experience. This series has four routers to choose from\n\u2013 the RV340, RV340W, RV345, and RV345P. Each model shares these important features:\nGigabit Ethernet ports, wired NAT performance, business grade firewalling, and secure internet\nconnectivity. Where they differ is in the number of LAN\nports.The RV340 has dual WAN ports for load balancing and failover. And four LAN ports for high performance connectivity. The RV340W has the same features, but with\nwireless capabilities. The RV345 has dual WAN ports and an integrated\n16 LAN port switch to allow for more space and more ports for all devices in the LAN. The RV345P takes it a step further by adding\nPower Over Ethernet, or PoE, to help reduce the expense of installing electric power cabling. That allows for flexibility of delivering\npower in places without outlets to devices like wireless access points or voice over\nIP phones. No matter which router you choose, an easy\nconfiguration setup wizard is there every step of the way. And Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobile Client\nSoftware is supported for iPhone, Android, Windows 10 or MacBook laptops. Block unwanted categories, dynamically blacklist\nwebsites, and set individual policies for applications to keep the network safe. The RV340 Series from Cisco. Scalable. Secure. Affordable. It\u2019s what small businesses need for the\nultimate in business efficiency. Thanks for watching Tech Talks from Cisco. We\u2019ll see you next time.",

    "transcript": "got multiple wireless access points in close proximity then you've got a need to configure radio settings for smooth communication and optimal performance if multiple laps in close proximity are broadcasting at the same frequency or channel the transmitted data can become corrupted or canceled out the bad news is that can greatly decrease performance the good news is it's easy to avoid today I'm going to show you how to configure advanced radio settings on the web 125 and web 581 for optimum wireless capability without worrying about interference interruptions let's get started first log into the web-based utility and choose Wireless then radio from the drop-down menu next select the radio interface you want to configure in our example today radio 1 5 gigahertz is selected what's the difference between the two the 2.4 gigahertz frequency is more compatible with older devices since it caters to 802 11 B G and n modes and has a wider range the 5 gigahertz frequency caters to 802 11 AC and n modes and is faster but has a shorter range one other thing to note on the WEP 125 the option to choose the radio is available only when the working mode has been set to dual band under the basic settings area make sure to check the enable radio button this is enabled by default next navigate to the Advanced Settings area and click the arrow next to it to expand the page and configure the settings for the chosen radio it's important to note that DFS support and spectrum analysis mode options will only be available on the web 581 also the DFS support field is only available if you are configuring radio 1 5 gigahertz dynamic frequency selection DFS automatically selects channel frequencies with the lowest interference use the drop-down list to either enable or disable this feature in our example the default is on if you are configuring radio to skip to the next step if you selected a mode that contains 802 11 n in wireless network mode drop-down in the basic settings area the short guard interval supported drop-down lists will be available the guard interval is the amount of time that the WAP weights between transmissions which prevents interference the guard interval can be shortened to increase throughput by up to 10% if this option is available select an option from the drop down list yes reduces transmission time to over 400 nanoseconds when communicating with clients that also support the short guard interval this is the default option no keeps transmission time to every 800 nanoseconds in this example yes is chosen choose an option from the protection drop-down list the protection feature contains rules to guarantee that a tow 2.11 transmission does not cause interference with legacy stations or application auto enables protection when legacy devices are within the range of the web this is the default option in this example auto is chosen in the beacon interval field enter the interval of milliseconds between beacon frame transmissions beacon frames announce the presence of the wireless network the value must be between 20 and 2,000 milliseconds the default is 100 cisco recommends keeping the default value a misconfigured beacon interval can cause clients to be unable to connect in this example you guessed it 100 is used next up is the delivery traffic information map period field here you will enter an integer from 1 to 255 beacons the DTM period indicates how often in terms of beacon frames the client served by your web should check for buffered data still awaiting pickup the default value is 2 which specifies that clients will check for buffered data on your web on every second beacon frame in the fragmentation threshold field enter an even number between 256 and 2346 bytes to specify the size limit for packets transmitted over the network if a packet exceeds the fragmentation threshold the fragmentation function is activated and the packet is sent as multiple 802 11 frames by default fragmentation is off at a threshold of 2346 bytes changing the fragmentation threshold is not recommended unless you experience radio threshold in our example 2346 is used in the RTS threshold field enter an integer between zero and two thousand three hundred and forty seven to specify the request to send threshold value the default here is two thousand three hundred and forty six a lower threshold value sends packets more frequently which results in higher bandwidth consumption and quicker recovery from collisions or interference on the network in this example 65535 is used in the max associated clients field enter the maximum number of clients that can connect to the web at one time the range is from zero to 200 with a default setting of 200 in the transmit power drop-down list select the percentage of transmit power the web uses when broadcasting a high percentage is more cost-efficient since it gives the web the widest range and requires fewer access points to cover the same area a low percentage requires devices to be close to each other but reduces the overlap and interference among apps the default is full 100 percent in the frame burst support drop-down list choose either off or on to disable or enable this feature choosing on may increased downstream throughput as it lets the radio quickly send a series of frames in secession for a brief period of time next up is the airtime fairness mode drop-down list this feature allows every clients connected to the web to have an equal opportunity to take advantage of the network bandwidth regardless of type capability or operating systems choose on or off in the maximum utilization threshold field enter the percentage of network bandwidth utilization allowed on the radio before the web stops accepting new client association the range is from 0 to 100% the default is 0 when it is set to 0 all new associations are allowed regardless of their utilization rate in the fixed multicast rate drop-down list select the transmission rate in megabits per second for broadcast and multicast packets the range of possible values is determined by the radio mode in the basic settings area selecting Auto lets the web automatically choose the best rate based on the connected clients today we are choosing Auto in the legacy rate set stable check the boxes under the available rates to determine the supported and basic rate sets supported is just how it sounds it indicates rates that the web supports basic rate sets are what the web advertises to the network to set up communication with other devices it is more efficient to have a WAP broadcast a subset of its support rates the rates are in megabits per second remember in order to select a rate as basic it must also be selected as supported check the broadcast multicast rate-limiting checkbox if you want to limit the number of packets transmitted across the network by default this feature is disabled if you enable broadcast multicast rate limiting the rate limit and rate limit burst fields will become available enter the appropriate values for each field rate limit is for multicast and broadcast traffic the rate is expressed in packets per second and the range is 1 through 50 the default is 50 rate limit burst indicates the amount of traffic that is allowed to pass as a temporary burst even if it exceeds the above maximum rate the range is 1 through 75 and the default is 75 in the spectrum analysis mode drop-down list choose a mode in which the web will conduct an analysis of the wireless environment options include dedicated spectrum analyzer where the radio is used for spectrum analysis for more than 10 percent of the time and the client connections may work but are not guaranteed hybrid spectrum analyzer where client connections are guaranteed but degradation is expected throughout 3+1 spectrum analyzer where clients connect to 3 by 3 chains while the spectrum analysis is done on a one by one chain and disabled which is the default mode remember spectrum analysis mode is only available on the web 581 here we've chosen the default mode of disable if necessary check the very high through or VHT features checkbox to enable the Broadcom specific extension for Broadcom to Broadcom links click the blue configure t spec button to open the fields and configure T spec settings first enter the T spec violation interval in seconds for the web to report associated clients that do not adhere to mandatory admission control procedures this reporting occurs through the system log and simple network management protocol traps otherwise known as SNMP the range is from 0 to 900 with a default of 300 in the T spec mode drop-down list choose the traffic specification mode for the web this is sent from a quality of service capable clients requesting a certain amount of traffic from the web shoes on to enable T spec and allow the web to handle traffic from quality of service devices shoes off to disable T spec and quality of service devices are not given priority in the T spec voice ACM mode drop-down list choose a mode that regulates mandatory admission control or a cm for the voice access category choose on to require that a station send a t spec request for bandwidth to the web before sending or receiving a voice traffic stream shoes off to allow stations to send and receive voice traffic without a t spec request this allows the web to control bandwidth usage for voice traffic in this example off is chosen in the T spec voice ACM limit field enter the maximum amount of traffic the web tries to transmit through wireless with a voice AC to gain access the range is 0 to 70% and the default is 20% in the T spec video ACM mode drop-down list choose a mode that regulates mandatory admission control or a cm for the video access category choose on to require that a station send a T spec request for bandwidth to the web before sending or receiving a video traffic stream shoes off to allow stations to send and receive video traffic without a t spec request as in the voice traffic section this allows the web to have control over bandwidth usage for video traffic in this example off is chosen next up is the T spec video ACM limit filled here enter the maximum amount of traffic the web tries to transmit through wireless with a video AC to gain access the range is from 0 to 70% and the default is at 15% in the T spec ap inactivity timeout field enter the number of seconds for a web to detect a downlink traffic specification as idle before deleting it the range is 0 to 120 seconds and the default is 30 entering 0 disables this feature in the T spec station inactivity timeout field enter the number of seconds for a web to detect an uplink traffic specification as idle before deleting it the range is 0 to 120 seconds and the default is 30 entering 0 disables this feature in the T spec legacy wmm queue map mode drop-down list select whether to enable or disable the intermixing of legacy traffic on queues operating as a CM by default this feature is disabled click OK to save your changes click Save a pop-up window will appear telling you that wireless connections may be disconnected upon saving the changes you made in your wireless settings click OK to continue congratulations you have now successfully configured the advanced radio settings on the WAP 125 and web 581 thanks for watching Tech Talks from Cisco we'll see you next time [Music]",

Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is an implementation of a distance-vector protocol for local and wide-area networks. It classifies routers as either active or passive (silent). Active routers advertise their routes to others; passive routers listen and update their routes based on advertisements, but do not advertise. Typically, routers run RIP in active mode, while hosts use passive mode. For additional support information, visit the Cisco Small Business Support Community: http://cs.co/9002DF7ts.",

    "transcript": "vpns are great tools but sometimes we might run into a slight hiccup or two in this edition of tech talks we'll show you how to troubleshoot some common vpn issues using the rv340 logs next ipsec vpn or virtual private network allows you to securely obtain remote resources by establishing an encrypted tunnel across the internet to start things off we'll click on system configuration then select log first we'll need to make sure that the log is enabled we can leave the log buffer at the default value of 1024. for severity we'll choose the debugging for our category we'll choose all we'll go ahead and apply these changes next up we'll head over to status and statistics for a few fun facts on our vpn we'll choose to view logs for the category we'll deselect all and individually checked vpn and ssl vpn we're only going to be looking at vpn traffic for severity we'll stick with all okay so before we get too hasty and show those logs we'll have to make sure we try and establish a vpn connection first and foremost after that's done we'll move on and click on show logs after the logs pop up we'll see that our vpn connection failed when we search through the logs we can see messages that are failing our login forms say we have an invalid hash or psk pre-shared key an incorrect pre-shared key can cause a vpn connection to fail let's fix the pre-shared key and then see if we can establish a vpn connection you know how your parents always told you to look both ways before you cross the street the same applies here my friends we'll want to check both sides of the vpn tunnel to make sure that the key is the same on both sides after checking both sites we were able to see that on our client side the pre-shared key was incorrect once the correction was made the tunnel was able to be established again we can recheck the loss by clicking the refresh button we can now see that we were able to establish a vpn connection and that there are no longer any failed messages here we can see in our logs that our pre-shared keys match but the fun troubleshooting issues don't end there folks let's look at another common issue with the vpn connection let's go ahead and refresh the logs in the logs we still see an invalid hash or pre-shared key we know that the pre-shared keys are fine however as down here we see an invalid idv1 payload length decryption failed message this message could mean we have an ipsec profile mismatch this is most likely within the encryption if the encryption fails then so will the free shared key let's check our ipsec profile on both sides of the vpn to see if they match we'll click on the vpn option and choose ipsec profiles we'll go ahead and look at the profile that we are currently using for the vpn for this example it's green underscore pro okay after reviewing both ipsec profiles on both ends we can see that the encryption on the client side is set to 3ds while on the rv 340 the encryption is aes aes128 let's change the encryption on the client side and see if we can get this vpn back up and running after changing the encryption to match phase 1 aes 128 we'll check to see if the vpn is running all right under a green underscore vpn we have one connection which means we were able to connect again and the issue was with the encryption we'll return to the logs to make sure we don't have any other errors we'll have to click on show logs again after scrolling down we can see that there are no failed messages the vpn tunnel was a success here in the logs we can also see the pre-shared keys are matching alright the hits keep on coming let's check out another common issue we can go ahead and clear our logs and try to connect the vpn again once we try to connect we'll refresh the logs right now we don't see any traffic in our logs oftentimes when you don't see any logs it could be a sign that the router isn't receiving any vpn traffic to fix this we first want to make sure that both of the vpn ends have an internet connection if they do we can check the firewall on the router as well as on the pc we're working on to make sure no corresponding traffic is blocked another possible issue is having an incorrect public ip address when we check the client side we can see that the remote gateway is incorrect let's correct this and try again after correcting the public ip address on the client side we're able to successfully connect to the vpn i'll check the logs again here we can see our logs and we shouldn't see any failed messages since we were successful think we're done saving the day not so fast let's check out another common issue after we've tried to establish a vpn connection let's click refresh and look at the laws here we see our pre-shared key configs did match but we see no peer config found this message could point to an issue with either a local id or a remote id issue we're going to double check our configurations we'll click on vpn and then client to site format [Music] our vpn is green underscore vpn we'll click to edit it and double check after checking our identifiers on the client side we see that the local identifier is not the same as the remote identifier on the rv 340. we'll change the local identifier on the client side to greenbowvpn.com since the fqdn isn't an actual domain that we own we can change this on either side of the vpn it's important that both match after making the changes on the client side we see that the vpn is up and that we have a connection this is why logs are so important in the rv 340. they help us immensely when trying to troubleshoot common vpn issues those are just a few of the common vpn issues and how to troubleshoot them using router logs thanks for watching tech talks from cisco we'll see you next time you",

    "transcript": "[Music] while online there are few things more important than protecting your privacy and that's why we're talking tunnels today client-to-site virtual private network connections are very useful since they create a vpn tunnel that allows users to access the network through vpn client software without compromising privacy or security they're a pretty nifty tool on this edition of tech talks we'll show how to set up a vpn connection with greenbow for client-to-site vpn next [Music] to start configuring the vpn we'll click on vpn and select ipsec profiles we'll go ahead and add a new ipsec profile here we can enter all its information we'll name it green underscore new for this example for our keying mode we'll leave it at auto we're also going to keep the ike version at ike version 1. for the phase 1 options we'll choose our dh group as group 2. encryption will be aes 128 for this example and our authentication will be sha-1 for the sa lifetime we will change it from the default to 86 400. now on to the phase two options we'll keep the protocol selection at dsp and change the encryption to aes 128. authentication will be shown 1 and we'll leave the sa lifetime at 3600. we've got perfect forward secrecy enabled now all we'll do is change the dh group to group 5 15 36 bits once finished we'll click apply to save our changes now we'll head over to client to site and click on add to create a new tunnel the first thing we're going to do on this new page is select third-party client next we can enable the tunnel and give it a name for this example we'll name it new underscore green bow for the interface option we must choose whichever one we're using for internet connection in this example we are using wan one the pre-shared key must be the same on the router as well as the client here we'll disable minimum pre-shared key complexity and show our pre-shared key for this example we're entering in green123 as our key under our local identifier we should have local wan ip and we should be able to see our public ip address in this example we cannot see the public ip address so we can choose ip address and add our public ip address to our configuration our remote identifier will be left as fqdn we can create the fqdn for the client in the next box we'll name it greenbowvpn.com for the pool range we'll create a private range for the clients our starting ip is 10.25.25.1 and the end ip is 10.25.25.30 this allows us to have 30 clients connected to this vpn next we're going to select the advanced settings tab to enter in some more settings under ipsec profile we're going to select the ipsec profile that we've created which was green underscore new our remote endpoint will be left as dynamic ip for the local group setup we'll select subnet for our local ip type and enter in the local subnet for our router for this example it's 192.168.0.0 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 under mode configuration we will leave all the settings as default now we'll click apply to save the changes we can now see our new tunnel at the bottom of the table great we have now finished configuring the client site configurations on router 345 it's now time to configure the greenbow vpn client we'll start by opening up the greenbow vpn next we'll need to right click on ikev1 and select new phase 1. we should now see the ikev1 gateway and we will open that it's time for some more settings our interface will be left as any and our remote gateway will be the public ip address of our rv router next we'll enter in our pre-shared key and confirm it as is and move down to cryptography the encryption will be aes120 the authentication will be shell one and finally the key group will be dh2 next we'll move over to the protocol tab the local id under identity will be dns we'll enter in the fqdm that we created on the rv greenbowvpn.com we'll then hop down to mode config and enable it we're going to move right along to the gateway settings we'll first change the lifetime to 86 400 seconds for the dead peer connection or dpd we're going to enter 15 seconds for the check interval 5 has the maximum number of retries and 15 seconds as the delay between retries we'll enter two for the retransmission to save our settings we'll go to configuration on the top left corner and select save we're going to right click on ipv1 gateway again and select new phase 2. now we can select ikev1 tunnel our address type will be the subnet address and we can enter in the subnet for our rv router our encryption will be aes128 the authentication will be sha-1 and the mode is tunnel alright then we'll enable the pfs and select dh5 for the group finally we can set the ipsec lifetime as 3600 to save these settings we'll go back to configuration on the top left corner and click save now that we've finished with the greenbow vpn client configuration we can open the tunnel we'll right click on ikev1 tunnel and select open tunnel when you see the seal you know it's real we now have our vpn connected and that's how to set up a vpn connection with the greenbow vpn client and rv340 series switch thanks for watching tech talks from cisco we'll see you next time [Music]",

is simple to deploy simple to manage and provides a solid foundation for business applications in this edition of tech talks we'll go over some of the features and configurations of the cbs350 next let's get started first we'll talk about the global leds found on the device system led lights flash steady green when the switch is powered on when booting when performing self-tests or acquiring an ip address if the led flashes amber the switch has detected a configuration file error or hardware or firmware failure to access the switch with the web-based interface you must know the ip address of the switch we're using the switch is using the factory default ip address of 192.168.1.254 the subnet of slash.4 when the switch is using the factory default ip address the system led flashes continuously when the switch is using a dhcp server assigned at the address or administrator has configured a static ip address the system led is a steady green dhcp is also enabled by default our default password and username will be cisco when we first log into the switch we will need to change the username and default password under dashboard the cbs offers simple intuitive dashboards and automates the deployment monitoring and lifecycle management of the switch we can see a resource utilization graph as well as the system health display and a brief glance at the ram logs stacking is available on the cbs 350 with as many as four switches it is available on 24 port and 48 port 4x models the product supports many features therefore the web gui includes hundreds of configuration and display modes these pages are divided into either basic or advanced now let's go through the getting started section this will guide us through how to install and manage our device we can use the various links and follow the on-screen instructions to quickly configure our switch we can enter the system location in the system contact next we can select the default host name or create a new one we can use this screen to create a new ip interface for the system choosing none will keep the current configurations we can keep or change the username and password on this screen next we can set the system clock from an smtp server or we can import the date and time from a local computer up next we'll demonstrate the vlan configuration wizard we can choose the interface that we would like to use as our trunk interface in this example we're going to use port 1 since this will be the port connected to our router we can also create a new vlan from this screen we'll create vlan 20 and name it admin we'll choose port 1 as a trunk port that will pass vlan 20 untake traffic we can also add access interfaces to vlan 20. we'll choose ports 13 through 16 as access ports for vlan 20. click apply to save there's also a configuration wizard for acl configuration but don't worry this topic will be discussed in another video [Music] we're now going to take a look at file management we'll click on administration choose file management and select firmware operations a file management system is an application that is used to store and arrange the access files that are on our device the system files contain information such as configuration info and firmware images a ton of actions can be performed with these files such as selecting the firmware file from which the device boots or modifying various types of configuration files internally we can also copy files to and from an external device we'll now go to the system log under administration we'll click on system log and log settings the system logs are enabled by default this section describes the system logging which enables a device to generate multiple independent logs each log is a set of messages describing system events the device generates the following local logs the logs sent to the console interface the logs written in a cyclical list of logged events in the ram and logs erased when the device reboots the logs written into a cyclical log file saved to the flash memory and persist across reboots in the remote log server we can send messages to remote syslog servers in the form of snmp traps and assist log messages another useful feature within the switch is the ping and it's located under administration the ping utility will test if the remote host can be reached and it measures the round trip for packet sent ping operates by sending internet control message protocols echo request packets to the target host and waits for icmp response enhanced security capabilities provide a solid foundation to safeguard the privacy of customers cisco business 350 series switches provide the advanced security features we need to protect our business data and keep unauthorized users off the network embedded secure socket layer ssl encryption for text management data traveling to and from the switch support for advanced network security applications such as the ieee 802.1 export security tightly limits access to a specific segment of our network the cisco business 350 series switches are available with as many as 40 power over ethernet ports this capability simplifies advanced technology deployments such as ip telephones and wireless and ip surveillance it does this by allowing users to connect and power network endpoints over a single ethernet cable and that's our walk through those are some of the features and configurations of the cbs 350. thanks for watching this edition of tech talks we'll see you next time",

    "transcript": "you've probably heard of apples on a stick or maybe hot dog on a stick but router on a stick might have escaped you thus far in life it sounds wacky but it's the incredibly useful topic of today's video albeit less appetizing in this edition of tech talks we'll show you how to configure router on a stick and enter vlan routing on an rv340 and cbs 350 switch next first we'll start off by configuring the cbs 350 switch we're going to want to create two new vlans let's head to vlan management here we can see our default vlan is vlan 1. it's best practice to change our default vlan but for this example we will leave it as default we'll click on add to create our new vlan here we'll give it a vlan id of 10 and name it sales we're going to leave the vlan interface state and link status snmp traps enabled all we've got to do next is click apply to add the vlan let's create another one this one will have an id of 20 and will be named hr we'll click apply to save next we're going to head over to ipv4 configuration we're going to click on add on the interface table here we can add an ipv4 interface for each vlan we'll start off with vlan 10. since we know what we want our ipv4 interface to be we'll choose static ip address for its type now we'll enter in the ip address we'll choose 10.15.10.10 with a network mask of 255.255.255.0 we'll click apply to save and close you guessed it we're going to do the same thing for vlan 20. this ip address will be 10.15.2 and the network mask will still be 255.255.255.0 we'll click apply one last time on the ipv4 interface page to save changes next we'll go to vlan management and choose interface settings we must make the port that is connected to the router a trunk port in this example interface ge1 is the port connected to our router we'll choose it and click edit all we've got to do here is switch the interface vlan mode to trunk and click apply next we'll add ports to our vlan to start we'll go to port vlan membership for this example we'll add ports 3 and 4 to vlan 10 one at a time after we choose port 3 we can click join vlan here we'll change the access vlan id to vlan 10. we'll leave the native vlan id at 1 and click apply to save we'll do the exact same thing for port 4. next we'll add ports 20 and 21 to vlan 20. we'll take the same steps as before but we'll change the axis vlan ids to vlan 20. now that we're finished configuring the switch we must configure our router so that we can have interviewland routing once we're logged into the router we can click on lan and choose vlan settings we need to create vlan 10 and 20 on the router we'll click on add and give it an id of 10. we need to make sure that inter vlan routing and device management are enabled for all of this to work next we've got to enter the ipv4 address in subnet mask if the router is going to be giving our addresses to the client we'll need to enable the dhcp server we can choose a range start and end but we'll leave it as default we'll click apply to save next we're going to add vlan 20 and follow the same steps as before but the ipv4 address will be 10.15.1 here we can see that the client is on vlan 10 and was able to ping our vlan 20 interface it looks like the ping was successful that's all there is to it that's how to configure router on a stick on the rv 340 and cbs 350 switch thanks for watching this edition of tech talks we'll see you next time you",

    "transcript": "[Music] vlans are very helpful when it comes to separating a network but because we cannot delete vlan 1 which is the default vlan we need to do a little editing in this edition of tech talks we'll show you how to change the default native vlan on the cisco cbs350 switch next [Music] let's begin by heading to the vlan settings under vlan management here we can see our default or native vlan vlan 1. for this example we're going to create two new vlans we'll click on add to create a new vlan our vlan id will be 10 and our name will be admin the vlan interface state and link status snmp traps are enabled by default we'll keep those as is next we'll click apply to save for our second vlan we'll give it an id of 20 and a name of new native vlan we'll click apply to save before we can continue it's important to point out that our administrative vlan should be different than the native vlan our administrative vlan should carry management traffic such as ssh all right next we'll head over to port to vlan we can see under vlan id that we are under vlan 1 and that all ports are under vlan 1 2. [Music] under vlan id we're going to choose one of the vlans we created for this example it's vlan 10. we'll click go to move forward now we need to assign a port to the vlan in this example since our end device is connected to the switch at port 3 we will leave this port assigned to vlan 1 because we would lose connection to the switch also since our switch is currently connected to our router outport 1 we'll leave port 1 on vlan 1 for now let's add port 5 to vlan 10 we'll switch the membership type to untagged and then apply to save next we'll add a port to vlan 20. we'll change the vlan id to 20 and hit go again we'll leave port 1 and port 3 to vlan 1. we'll choose port 2 to add to vlan 20 since nothing is currently connected to port 2 we'll switch its type to untagged and then click apply to save once again next we're going to move to ipv4 interface under the ipv4 configurations tab here we can see our default vlan 1 ipv4 interface but we'll need to create new ipv4 interfaces for our new vlans we'll click on add to get started first we'll change the vlan to 10. here we can choose the dynamic ip address and the ipv4 address will be assigned from dhcp however it may be more beneficial to assign a static ip address so that it will be consistent and not change for this example we'll enter an rip address which is 10.15.10.10 and a network mask of 255.255.255.0 we'll click apply to save next we're going to add an ipv4 interface for vlan 20 which will be our new native vlan again we'll switch to vlan 20 select static ip address and enter in our information we'll click apply to save once we've created our new ipv4 interface for our new vlans we can delete the vlan 1 ipv4 interface it's important to do this only after we've created our new ipv4 interfaces if we were to delete it before creating the new ones we would be locked out and would have to factory reset the switch to delete vlan 1 we'll go ahead and select it and click on the delete icon once we've deleted vlan 1 we see that we are no longer connected to the switch that's because we have deleted the interface to which we were connected we can still access the switch since we've created new ipv4 interfaces for our new vlans however we'll need to change the ipv4 address on the end user to the subnet of the new ipv4 interface that we just created in this example we're using a pc on windows 10 so we can change the computer's ipv4 address by going to settings we'll click on network and internet and change adapter options here we can right-click on ethernet and choose properties we should see internet protocol version 4. double click it and make sure use the following ip address is chosen then enter in our ip address since we have an interface at 10.15.10.10 we must make sure that our pcip address will also be within that subnet here we changed our ip address to 10.15.10.5 which is in the same subnet as our ipv4 interface that we created we can now go ahead and click ok twice and then close out of that window next we can double check that our configuration was changed by checking in the command prompt under the command prompt we'll go ahead and enter ipconfig and enter it here we can see that our ip address did change to 10.15.10.5 if not we'll need to go back and change the ip address make sure that we remember that we are currently connected on port 3 on the switch which is still on vlan 1. we'll need to change the port to which our pc is connected it will need to be on a port that is in vlan 10 since that is the ipv4 interface to which we'll try to connect earlier we added port 5 to vlan 10 so we will now connect the pc to port 5 on that switch we'll open a new browser and enter the ipv4 address of our ipv4 interface that we created it's 10.15 we see here that the switch's gui has popped up we'll log back into the switch once we're inside we're going to click on vlan management and select port to vlan under the vln id we see that we are under vlan 1. if we scroll down we can see that we still have a lot of ports that are assigned to vlan 1. we need to assign these ports to vlan 20 because it is the new native vlan before we do that let's go ahead and click on the vlan id change it to 10 and click go here we can see that port 5 is currently in vlan 10. we need to remember that so we don't change that port in the future we'll leave that port as is now let's switch to vlan 20 click go we can now go ahead and assign all the ports that were on vlan 1 to vlan 20. we'll exclude vlan 10 though which was port 5 and untagged the rest of the ports once we're done assigning the rest of the ports to vlan 20 we'll click apply now we'll move on to port vlan membership here we see that all the ports are in vlan 20 with the exception of port 5. the next thing we'll have to do is change the native vlan on all ports to the new native vlan if we select our port and click join vlan we can edit the native vlan id under trunk mode membership currently this is set at vlan 1. we need to change that to 20. we'll click apply ideally we want all ports to have the same native vlan so we'll have to change all the ports once we've changed all ports we'll have successfully changed the default or native vlan on the switch thanks for watching tech talks from cisco we'll see you next time you",

    "transcript": "reliability it's one of the best traits you could ask for when you need a reliable solution to share online resources and connect computers phones and wireless access points cisco business 250 series smart switches are the way to go they provide ideal solutions at an affordable price that's perfect for any home or small business in this video we'll talk about some of the features of the cbs 250 and walk through a few configurations next first let's talk about the global leds found on our device the system led lights flash green when the switch is powered on booting performing self-tests or acquiring an ip address if the light ever flashes amber though the switch has detected hardware or firmware failure or a configuration file error to access a switch with a web-based interface we've got to know the ip address the switch is using switches use the default factory ip address of 192.168.1.254 with a subnet of 24. when the switch is using the default ip address the system led flashes continuously when the switch is using a dhcp server assigned ip address or an administrator has configured a static id address the system led is a steady green and the dhcp is enabled by default it's time to log in cisco spell lowercase is our default username and password once inside we'll be prompted to change our username and password we'll do so now under the dashboard the cbs250 offers a simple intuitive dashboard that powers the deployment monitoring and life cycle management of our switches here we can see the resource utilization graph as well as the system health display and ram memory logs this product supports many more features therefore the web gui includes hundreds of configurations and display pages these pages are divided into basic and advanced display modes the advanced mode offers a full set of configuration options when the user switches from basic to advanced the browser page will reload [Music] now let's go through the getting started section this will guide us through how to install and manage our device we can use the various links and follow the on-screen instructions to quickly configure our switch [Music] we'll go to the configuration wizards next here we can go through a quick and easy configuration wizard after the initial setup wizard we'll enter in the system location and contact we can also use the default host name or define our own once that's finished we'll click next then we'll create a new ip interface we can choose the none option to keep the current configuration on the next page we can change the username and password for this example we'll select to keep the current username and password on the next page we can set up the system clock from the smtp server or we can import the time from our local computer we'll click next and hit apply to save our changes now we'll navigate to the vlan configuration wizard we can choose the interface we'd like to use as the trunk interface in this instance we'll use port 1 since it is the port connected to our router we can also create a new vlan on the next page we'll create vlan 20 and name it admin on the next page we'll choose port 1 as the trunk port that will pass vlan 20 on trunk traffic after that we can also add access interface to vlan 20. for this example we'll choose ports 13 through 16. to finish up we'll click apply to save [Music] there's also a configuration wizard that can allow for an acl configuration but we'll leave that for another video if we head over to administration and file management we'll find the firmware operations a file management system is an application that is used to store arrange and access the files that are on our device the system files contain information such as configuration information or firmware images various actions can be performed with these files like selecting the firmware file from which device boots modifying various types of configuration files internally or copying files to or from an external device such as an external server up next is the system log we'll go straight to the log settings this section describes the system logging which enables a device to generate multiple independent logs each of these logs is a set of messages describing system events this allows for a quick overview of events inside the switch's history this is a very handy tool for any home office or small business office the device generates the following logs local logs logs sent to the console interface logs written in a cyclical list of logged events in the ram and a race when device reboots and logs written in a cyclical log file saved to the flash memory and persisting across reboots in addition we can send messages to the remote syslog servers in the form of snmp traffics and slot messages another useful feature within the switch is the ping the ping utility will test if a remote host can be reached and measures the round-trip time for the packet sent ping operates by sending internet control messages protocol or icmp echo request packets to the target host and waits for an icmp response it measures a round trip time and records any packet loss if we activate ping we can see that we do not have internet connection we sent off four packets and none were received that is why our packet loss is now 100 this is a great way to test internet connectivity within the switch finally we'll talk about poe we're going to click on port management poe and then properties cisco business 250 series switches are available with as many as 48 power over ethernet ports this capability simplifies advanced technology deployments like ip telephones and wireless and ip surveillance by allowing us to connect and power network endpoints over a single ethernet cable this offers simplicity of use to any type of user there are many features within the cbs 250 such as smart port multicast access control list and qos which will be discussed in later videos thanks for getting to know the cisco business 250 series smart switch and for watching tech talks from cisco we'll see you next time",

network that we want to manage the probe discovers the network collects performance and configuration data from the discovered devices and reports that information back to the dashboard [Music] the first thing we'll do is download the cisco business dashboard probe software for vmware from cisco website to do this we'll navigate to the cisco business dashboard support page which is referenced in the description of this video once on the page we'll go to the downloads tab under probe software we'll click on the download options we need to locate the download option for virtual machine image for vmware and click the download icon in this case we are downloading the 2.3.0 probe version now we need to make sure we have a working vmware virtualization environment available to host the virtual machine in this case we are using the esxi version 7.0.0 to create the virtual machine we'll click on the create or register vm option then we'll select the deploy a virtual machine from an ovf or ova file option as we have downloaded the probe virtual machine image in signed over file format and click next here we will enter a name for the virtual machine we will use cbd underscore 2.3.0 underscore new underscore pro now we'll go ahead and click on the click to select files or drag drop option locate the profile that we have just downloaded and click open then go ahead and click on next we need to select a data store for the virtual machine in this case store 1 is selected by default we will keep the same and click next again now we need to select the deployment options we will leave the default settings here and hit next here we can verify the settings everything looks good so we'll click on finish we can see the process has started now under recent tasks this process will take some time to complete we need to make sure the network interface on the newly created virtual machine is connected and bridged to the correct physical interface on the host machine the network interface of the cisco business dashboard probe should be connected to a vlan containing the management interfaces for at least one of the network devices if the probe is not directly connected to at least one network device it may be unable to fully discover the network once the tasks result shows as completed successfully we will go ahead and click on the name of the virtual machine we just created we can see the virtual machine is powered on currently now we will click on the console we need to enter the login which is cisco and then the password which is cisco as well all lowercase and hit enter we will need to change the password now for the login cisco we will enter cisco for the current password and then type in our new password and hit enter we need to retype the new password again so we will enter the same password again and hit enter we need to repeat the same process one more time we will do that now we can see the cisco business dashboard probe has been initialized and the administration gui ip is reflecting now we will open a browser and enter the administration gui ip address to access the cisco business dashboard probe gui we will likely get a page that looks similar to this your connection is not private this page is appearing since the probe has a self-signed certificate on it initially so this screen is normal we will click on advanced and then select proceed to 172.16.1.170. here we need to enter the username which is cisco and password which again is cisco all lowercase now we need to update the login information and change the default user we need to select a username we want to use in this case we'll use admin then we will enter the old password which is cisco all lowercase and then type in the new password and retype the new password and click save now we'll get the option to establish the dashboard connection we can skip that option as well but in this case we'll go ahead and enter the ip address of the cisco business dashboard manager we wish to connect to this probe and click finish we can also use a domain name here if we're using a domain name then we need to make sure that the probe will need to be able to resolve the domain name now we need to enter the username and password for cisco business dashboard to authenticate and click login here we need to enter the name of the network as well as the location to associate or create a network and then click finish now we can see that the cisco business dashboard has been connected with the domain we've specified also we'll be able to see the different options available under administration menu in cisco business dashboard probe on the cisco business dashboard manager we will navigate to network menu and we can see the newly created network we will click on that network name to see the network topology and that's all there is to it that's how we can set up the cisco business dashboard probe 2.3.0 in vmware esxi thanks for

    "transcript": "yes i'll need that on my desk by monday no excuses listen having a commanding presence is everything in business and network it management is no exception in this cisco tech talk we'll walk through some of the most commonly used functions for the command line interface on cbs 350 and 250 switches next in this demo we'll cover the gamut of cli commands including creating a host name a username and password disabling and enabling smart ports globally configuring a static ip on vlan 1 configuring multiple vlans configuring access and trunk ports for vlans and finally saving our configuration to the switch's startup config as you can see we're already connected to our switch with a terminal let's start by logging into the switch we'll first notice that the hostname of the switch is in the first line on the command prompt in order to change this we'll need to be in global configuration mode we'll start by typing configuration and hit enter this will take us into the global configuration mode next we'll type hostname and the name that we would like to assign to the switch in this case we'll use switch 3. we can also verify this by exiting out of the global configuration mode by typing either exit or end and performing a show command in this case show system next let's create a user who can log into the switch as an administrator first we'll enter the global configuration mode from here we simply start typing username then the name of the user we want to create in this case we'll create tim now add the command password and after that type the password you want to use at this point we can choose whether or not to encrypt the password if we hit the space bar and add a question mark we'll be shown available commands for this example we'll use the sha-512 for our encryption on the password we can also change the privilege to assign the user as an administrator they will need both read and write privileges we'll enter privilege for this command followed by control question mark we'll have the option of privilege one privilege 7 in privilege 15. privilege level 1 is meant for basic users with just read only rights privilege 15 includes read and write access for this example we'll choose 15. we've now created this user and can once again exit out typing exit will log us out of the switch we will now log back in with our newly created user from here we can select show users command to see that tim has logged in on the serial location for 30 seconds much of the information we might need on a switch can be ascertained by entering the show running configuration command and tapping enter this will show us the configuration of the switch which currently is set as default configuration we'll see our hostname we've created as well as our users with password encryption most of our switches come with what's called smart port what this does is allow the switch to determine what is physically plugged into its ports and based on macros that are configured it will auto configure the port auto configuring can sometimes cause headaches if we're not aware of the specifics of how it works to help alleviate this we can disable our smart port to do so we'll enter our global configuration mode and simply type macro auto disabled and then enter to turn this back on later we'd simply run the same command and follow it up by typing enable and to set the switch to default settings type no macro auto next we'll add a static ip address to vlan 1 on the switch first we'll enter our global configuration mode and type interface vlan 1. our command will begin with our ip address in this case 172.19.76.4 followed by our subnet mask in this case 255.255.255.0. from here we can take a look at our configuration with the show command to execute an exec level command from global configuration mode or any configuration sub-mode use the do command we'll type the word do first followed by show running configuration we can now see that interface vlan 1 has our ip address assigned to it no ip address dhcp simply means we are not pulling an ip address dynamically next let's talk configuring vlans while in our global configuration mode we'll type vlan 20 to start we also have the option to create a vlan in this case vlan 30 by typing the command interface vlan 30. this command will also take us into the vlan interface allowing us to configure the interface directly typing in command do show vlan we'll now see that we've created vlan 20 and vlan 30. if we want to add a name to the vlan we can do that here as well type name and then the name you would like to call the vlan for this example we're going to call it data to switch back and forth between the vlans type interface vlan 20. from here we can change the name of our other vlan which we'll call voice [Music] now for a pro tip to find commonly or frequently used commands simply use your up and down arrow keys to cycle through previously typed commands [Music] next up we'll configure an interface as an access port for both vlan 20 and vlan 30. to do this we'll access port 10. we'll type interface g1 0 10 for port 10 and create an access port by typing switchport mode access next we'll assign it to a vlan by typing switchboard access vlan 20. subsequently we'll change interface 11 to vlan 30. by using our arrow keys we'll bring up the command to enter interface and change it to 11. as you can see we are currently in the interface g1 0-11 and we can cycle through to our switchboard mode access and switchboard access feeling 20 simply deleting 20 and adding 30. we can verify this once again with the command show vlan we can see now that port 10 is on vlan 20 as untagged along with port 11 on vlan 30 as untagged still with me great to round things out we'll walk through creating a trunk port we'll enter interface 12 and in this case instead of using a command to switch port mode access we're going to use the command switch port mode trunk to assign the vlans we'll enter the command to switch port trunk along vlan and use 1 20 and 30. we'll also need to add a native vlan which is the untagged vlan for the trunk we'll type switchport trunk native vlan and in this case we are using vlan 1. we can verify our changes by using show vlan and we'll see that port 12 is tagged vlan 20 and 30 and port 12 is untagged vlan 1. the command show running configuration will allow us to see that we have configured multiple ports as access ports or trunk ports as well as which vlans are allowed the final step saving the configuration we'll type exit and hit enter twice and type the command copy running configuration startup configuration this is so that when the switch reboots the saved changes will be applied we'll be asked to confirm yes or no to finalize the changes and that's a rundown of the basics of cli commands for cbs 350 and 250 switches thanks for watching this cisco tech talk we'll see you next time

technology it's important to be up to date to avoid simple inconveniences in this cisco tech talk we're going to show you how to update your firmware on your cisco business wireless next a software update ensures that both the primary ap software and software on all the associated subordinate aps are updated newly joining aps will be upgraded to the current version of the software running on the primary ap the software download happens in the background without impacting the network the upgrades are automatically sequenced to ensure that the network performance is not impacted by software update the software of up to three access points can be concurrently updated first up we'll need to download the software from the cisco website go to software.cisco.com and then scroll down and select wireless choose business 200 series access points and select the business 240 ac access point the latest version reads 10.4.1 we'll download that file by pressing the blue icon for the mesh extenders navigate back to the website under wireless pick business 100 series mesh extenders choose the appropriate model 141 142 or 143 once the files are downloaded check the file it should say cbw dash bundle dash 10-4-1 dash right-click and extract this file we should see more files pop up the ap1 g5-capwab file is for the mesh extenders and this ap1 g5 file is for the access points model we can update the cbw ap software using the primary ap's web interface current configurations on the primary ap will not be deleted navigate to the access points we need to log into the primary ap access point navigate to the management tab and choose software update you'll get a notification that says update wireless mesh extender before updating the master ap right now those mesh extenders are connected on the access point we can see there is a primary ap master capable showing there is a mesh extender connected to it we'll go back to the software update page and we'll enable the mesh extenders we'll see a notification that reads wireless mesh extender image file name should be ap1 g5-capweb select the file by clicking browse enter the folder select that file and click open click update we'll get a notification saying master is going to initiate the image pre-downloaded process now if any scheduled update is configured it will be cancelled click ok it will show the firmware update in progress there are three steps one http code transfer for mesh extenders starting where we'll see percentage rising two triggered mesh extenders to image pre-download three pre-download completed from mesh extenders proceed updating image for master ap all steps should be checked in order to proceed there are a few transfer methods we can use to update the firmware http tftp sftp cisco.com or cbd-https for this example we'll use the http method now we'll disable this mesh extender image and select the transport mode as http this version is showing 10.3.1.0 next we'll upgrade the ap firmware this is the cisco business wireless 240 ac browse that file that is ap1 g5 click open then update we'll get the same notification from last time so just click ok and that will start the process then there are three steps http code transfer starting triggered aps to image pre-download and master ap will be reset after all access points are updated once they're done the ap will automatically restart to make sure it does scroll down and see the auto restart box is checked after it's done log in to the master ap the master ap page should appear we can see the current firmware version is showing us 10.4.1.0 this is how we can upgrade to firmware in cisco business wireless mesh exchanger and access point and we're not done yet there are other methods we can perform to get the same results one is selecting the tftp for transfer mode for this we'll need to provide tftp ip address and our file path where this firmware file is located we also have the option to schedule the update if we select sftp mode we need to enter the ip address details first then port number by default it will be 22. we need to specify the file path where the firmware file is located then username and password we also have the option to schedule the update under sftp mode we can also select cisco.com make sure automatically check for updates is enabled we'll have the choice to disable if you'd like you can also see the last software update the process does take a moment once it's done it will show when the last time the software check was done currently latest software release is showing up to date the last method cbd-https can be done if the cisco business wireless is connected to the cisco business dashboard we need to select the appropriate action in the cisco business dashboard to upgrade the firmware on this cbw access point these are the methods we can use to upgrade the firmware in cisco business wireless access points doesn't it feel better to be up to date

access points or mesh extenders is a snap and can be done right through your cisco business dashboard in this cisco tech talk we'll show you how to use your cbd with your cisco business wireless next [Music] first we'll log into the cisco business dashboard we'll enter our username and password and log in okay we're in there are several things we should see on the screen but the main thing we'll focus on is the access point and device deployed for this example we're using the cbd 2.2.2 version let's go to the network menu where we can see which network is deployed branch one network is configured under cbd main office organization click on branch 1 and we'll see that cbw 140 ac is connected with the cisco business 250 switch and that's it on the right we'll find the primary ap function that controls the wireless network click on view to access the wireless network we're in we have access to the cvw access point we'll click on the login button we'll be prompted once more for our username and password click ok and we should be logged into the cisco business wireless network on the main page we should see that we're in the cbw 140 ac we can also see wireless network access points active clients connected and rogue ap details let's go to the management tab and select software update we can see the current firmware version on this access point 10.4.1 under the advanced settings click snmp we should see the snmp service is enabled we'll need to make sure that this service is enabled so that it can communicate to cisco business dashboard we'll also need to make sure that snmp access version 2c and version 3 are enabled we can see that read only community and read write community are configured [Music] scroll down and we'll see the snmp version 3 user details let's visit our cbd settings page we can see that the connection status is down these cisco business dashboard settings are required for direct management where there's no cbd probe configured on the network if we need to enable this setting we'll first need to provide the information requested below once we finalize we'll need to click save let's head back to our cisco business dashboard home page [Music] home sweet home to see more details about our cbw deployment head to the inventory tab this is where you can find access point details click on any of the host names to learn more about that device in this case it is a cbw140ac we can see the model number mac address and its ip details complete piv vid the serial number the vendor's name the device group associated with branch network organization name firmware version and discovery method the protocols that are enabled on this access point we'll head to the dashboard tab where we can see information like the client count and traffic slot 0 is currently selected if we choose gigabit ethernet we can see the traffic for that interface [Music] we can see 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz traffic for their respective ssids if we scroll down further we can see the cpu utilization the notification details the uptime associated client details and the rogue ap under the pnp tab we can select the image we need to upload to this access point cisco business wireless 140 ac we can also upload configuration right now nothing is added here so it's not reflecting if we go to the wireless lan tab we can see several wireless configuration parameters for radio 0 and radio 1. scrolling downward we can see the ssid configured in 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz as well as the associated clients in each ssid and under the config backups tab we can see that currently there is no data to display and there's no backup configured however we can click on this backup configuration button to backup the device configuration under the pending configuration tab we can see apply appended configuration accept current configuration and read current configuration options there are a few colors that highlight the different types of configurations such as a red color to indicate a removed configuration green for a replaced configuration and blue for an added configuration when we navigate to the event log tab that's where we can see events happen on the cbw 140 ac device we can see the cpu utilization here as well as the reachability status and the time interval we can also head to the reports menu and select the wireless network currently cisco sbssid is selected so it is displaying that data if we choose the cbd demo ssid that is configured on the cbw network we can see the client count and the traffic details for those clients we can see the details based on days weeks months etc we can also filter the organization from this drop down in the top right corner and we can specify the wireless network that we are looking for scrolling down we'll see the specific ssid and client count peak details as well as other details like client count average traffic peak and traffic average for each ssid diving deeper we'll see spectrum usage client counts and traffic details we can also find radio frequency network organization and peaks and averages for client count and traffic we will also see wireless access point details including various time intervals we'll also notice the rogue ap details near to our cbw 140 ac device we can note the average signal strength of the channel used right here under the wireless client report page we can see the wireless client count the detailed data rate and the ssid name we can also find usage such as upload and download details and the maximum data rate we can also view the uptime such as how long users are online we'll also be able to see wireless guest details right now there is no guest associated so this data is not reflecting we can also add the new wireless network on cisco business wireless from cisco business dashboard to do that we'll need to navigate to the network configuration menu and select the wireless lan option here we can see that the cbd demo ssid is showing on the cisco business wireless access point cbw140ac we'll add a new wireless network here under the wireless lan option click the add button to create a new ssid we'll enter the profile name as new ssid we'll choose the organization from the drop-down in this case cbd main office now we need to choose the device group we'll choose cbd main office and drag that to the right side back under the wireless lan option we'll click add to create the ssid and we'll give it the name new cbw ssid next we'll choose the radio interface from the drop down we can choose from 2.4 gigahertz 5 gigahertz or both interfaces we'll choose both for this example we'll then need to specify the vlan id as well and enable and broadcast options to enable the wireless lan under the security option we'll choose wpa2 personal from the dropdown this is supported in cisco business wireless so we need to provide the passphrase key finally we'll click save [Music] we can see that a newly added ssid is reflecting here click save to configure this wireless network in cisco business wireless from this cisco business dashboard yes the job was created successfully and now we can see the done with success status the ssid has been configured we can verify this by checking the cisco business wireless ap go to wireless settings and click on the wlans option on this page we can see that the newly created ssid new cbw ssid is reflecting here through time the needs of your network can change isn't it great to know that cisco business dashboard helps make changes simple and easy

    "transcript": "we all have problems what's important is that when they arise we know how to solve them in this cisco tech talk we're going to perform an rv 340 series router ran 2 routing example with troubleshooting next before we start we'll need a roadmap of our network this is the network topology we'll use for this example as we can see there are two routers router 1 and router 2. the wan one interface of both routers is connected to the internet that allows the vlan 1 traffic of each router to have internet access we can see that both routers when twos are connected to the wan service provider router in our example we're going to divert the lan traffic of vlan 1 from router 2 through the wan2 link toward router 1's vlan 1 interface we'll configure both routers and the wan service provider router in this scenario router 2 is connected to the wan service provider router with the 70.0.0.0.30 private ip connectivity router 1 is connected to the wan service provider router with the 40.0.0.0.30 ipconnectivity there are two hosts connected on the routers on router 1 192.168.2 on router 2 192.168.170.109 we'll check the reachability from this host on router 2 to this host on router 1. then we'll verify that the traffic from the hosts are forwarding through the wan2 interface of the router 1 and 2. [Music] we'll start by configuring router 1. 192.168.200.1 is the vlan 1 ip log into the router on the status and statistics page we'll be able to see the firmware information 1.0.03.21 scroll down and we can see that wan1 and wan2 are both connected up and configured with an ip address wan one is already configured with a public ip and providing internet access [Music] when two is configured with the ip settings and is connected to the wan service provider on this router we have to configure the static routing to forward the traffic to the next hop interface this is the lan ipool 192.168.170.0 of the router 2. we are forwarding to the next hop interface that is configured on the wan service provider router that is 40.0.0.2 via the wan2 interface and for the other side of the wan link network we are forwarding the traffic to the next hop interface 40.0.0.2 via wan2 interface while we are configuring the static routing of the wan2 we need to disable its nat functionality navigate to access rules allow traffic from wan2 to the vlan 1 interface 4001 and 4002 our default in this rv 340 series router we need to allow this rule manually navigate to basic settings where we have disabled the firewall settings currently for troubleshooting [Music] however we can enable that one and verify the services based on the requirement to see the routing table we can navigate to status and statistics click on the routing table and it will show the available routes on this router we'll now check router 2. log in and we'll see the firmware details this is updated with 1.0.03.21 both the wan interfaces are connected up and configured with the ip when one is configured with the public ip and providing the internet connectivity wan 2 is configured with our private ip as mentioned on the network topology we've added the static route to forward the traffic of the router 1 land traffic towards the next hop interface that is configured on the wan service provider router also for the other side 30ip link that is 40.0.0.0 we're forwarding that traffic to the next hop interface 70.0.0.1 both are via the wan2 interface and metrics are configured as one navigate to firewall settings and check our network address translation we can see that we've disabled the nat functionality on the wan 2. when one is doing the natting to provide the internet connectivity to the vlan 1 users and through win2 link we are using static routing to forward the traffic to the other site router also we've allowed traffic from wan2 to vlan 1. we need to configure this manually we've disabled the firewall settings under the basic settings for troubleshooting purposes we can verify that this router is getting the internet connectivity we can ping any public domain name or ip and we can see that it is getting a reply from that domain now we'll navigate to the wan service provider router we're using a cisco business rv 340 series router once we log in we can see that this one is upgraded with the 1.0.03.21 firmware we'll see both wayn interfaces are connected wan 1 is connected to router 1 and wan 2 is connected to router 2. we've configured the static route accordingly on this wan service provider router for router 1 lan traffic it's forwarding it to 40.0.0.1 via the lan 1 interface the lan traffic of the router 2 192.168.170. is forwarding the traffic to the 70.0.0.2 via the wan2 interface let's verify the reachability this system 192.168.170.109 is connected to the router 2 lan interface we can also see that under dhcp binding we can also check on the other side router dhcp bindings and we'll see there's a host connected 192.1 we'll verify the reachability of this host 192.168.200.107 from the host 192.168.170.109 ping 192.168.200.107 it's able to reach the other site network to verify how it's reaching we'll use the tracert command and provide the ip of that remote site system we'll see how the traffic is navigating from this system via the wan2 link to the other site the first hop will be the lan interface of this router that is 192.168.17 then the traffic is reaching at the wan service provider router wan interface that is 70.0.0.1 then the traffic is reaching the wan2 interface of the router 1. that is 40.0.0.1 and finally it's reaching the destination 192.168.200.107. we can also verify the other device's reachability like we can verify the reachability of the vlan 1 network of the router 1. it is pinging we can verify the wan2 interface ip of the remote side router we can verify the wan ip of the wan service provider router as well we can also verify the other side link reachability in case any of these routes are missing on the wan service provider side then the reachability will be lost on the wam service provider router we need to make sure every necessary route is configured also we can troubleshoot this by using wan packet capture on our wan 2 in router 1. we'll start the packet capture and ping the router 1 wan2 interface we can ping router 1's lan interface then ping the host connected on the router 1 vlan 1 interface let's stop the packet capture and click export to see our results we can save the file or open it using wireshark to verify the ping reply we'll filter with the icmp protocol we can see the request and reply from the system this is the system from 192.168.170.109 that has initiated the request and is getting a reply to the wan2 interface of router 1. we can also see the request from the lan interface also we can see the reply from the host system as well this is how we configure and verify the static routing via the wan2 interface in cisco business rv 340 series routers problem solved thanks for watching this cisco tech talk we'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "here at cisco we love creating a bridge between hope and possibility one way we do that is by helping to create an l2tp ipsec vpn connection for a client to their router in this cisco tech talk we'll do just that from a client's default vpn on a pc with windows 10 to an rv340 series router next [Music] l2tp otherwise known as a layer 2 tunneling protocol is a vpn protocol that doesn't offer any encryption or protection from the traffic that passes through it for this reason it's usually paired with ipsec which is an encryption protocol l2tp outperforms pptp the older protocol it's also used on multiple platforms and is supported on windows and mac ios operating systems and devices it's easy to set up and more secure than the older version so therefore we use l2tp with ipsec they make a great pair now in order to make a successful client-to-site connection there are four steps we must take the first step is to create the ipsec profile we start in the rv 340 router and we'll want to navigate to the left and click on vpn there we'll be able to see ipsec profiles currently we have a windows underscore l2tp profile created let's select it and edit the profile we'll want to make sure the ike version is version 1. after which we'll navigate to phase one to make sure the encryption is set at three des authentication at sha 1 and sa lifetime at 86 400. our phase 2 encryption and authentication should match phase one protocol selection should read esp and sa lifetime should read 28 800. now for step 2 configuring the l2tp server we'll head back to our router and on the left hand side lttp server at the top make sure on is selected mtu is set to default at 1400 we'll confirm our start ip address the dns is all based on our network at the bottom we can see the ipsec associated with the profile that we created we have our pre-shared key which is a password we can customize don't forget to click apply at the top to save our settings on to step three configuring the windows client in windows we have the vpn set to default and we'll add our vpn connection as for the provider we'll use the built-in option offered in windows the connection name can be whatever we'd like for example we'll use windows underscore lt2p next we'll enter in the server name and address now for vpn type we're going to roll with l2 tpip sec with pre-shared key we'll enter our pre-shared key in from before finally we'll click save [Music] lastly step 4 modifying the vpn connection settings now we can really get connected first we're going to navigate to the change adapter options here at the top right then we're going to navigate our windows l2tp connection we created and select properties next go to the security tab and click allow these protocols following that we'll select unscripted pap and uncheck the chat click ok now if we go back to our vpn connection and try to connect we should be good to go [Music] you know i feel like we've really connected over the last few minutes time will truly cherish if you want to spend more time with us check out our other videos thanks for watching this cisco tech talk see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "in life you want to feel secure both emotionally and electronically well we can't help you with your personal life but we can with your online accessibility in this cisco tech talk we're going to show you an advanced topic using cbs 350 switch to provide extra security to your network next before we get started this is an advanced topic knowledge of dhcp and vlans is required we will be covering layer 3 switching dhcp snooping dhcp relay agent and ipsourceguard these configurations are not required for all networks let's start by checking our topology we have two cbs 350 switches switch 1 and switch 2. our dhcp servers are connected to our switch 1 and our dhcp client is connected to our switch 2. both our switch 1 and our switch 2 have different networks switch 1 has vlan 1 in the network of 10.15.101.0 24 and vlan 10 is in the network of 10.15 24. switch 2 has vlan 1 in the network of 10.15.120.0.24 and vlan 10 is in the network of 10.15.130.0 24. in order to have inter vlan communication we will enable port 12 on both switches 1 and 2 as layer 3 interfaces with this configured we'll have intervlan communication between the two switches we also need to add static routes to both switches in this example we will also want our dhcp clients to receive a dhcp address from the dhcp server to do this we will need to add a dhcp relay agent to point switch 2 to our dhcp server a dhcp relay agent is any host that forwards dhcp packets between clients and servers relay agents are used to forward requests and replies between clients and servers when they are not on the same physical subnet we will configure dhcp relay to point switch 2 to the location of the dhcp server to make sure nothing gets tampered with we'll want to change some security settings this will add extra layers of protection to our network let's start by adjusting dhcp snooping this is one of the few times where snooping can be used for good dhcp snooping is a security feature that acts like a firewall between untrusted hosts and trusted dhcp servers it validates dhcp messages received from untrusted sources and filters out invalid messages snooping prevents false dhcp responses and monitors clients we will set port 12 on switch 2 as our trusted port dhcp server messages can flow through trusted ports dhcp server messages will be dropped if attempting to flow through a port that isn't trusted we will also configure ipsourceguard on switch 2 port 20. while this is ample protection it never hurts to have backup that comes in the form of an ipsource guard ipsourceguard is a security feature that restricts ip traffic on untrusted layer 2 ports by filtering traffic based on the dhcp snooping binding database or manually configured ipsource bindings this feature helps prevent ipv spoofing attacks when a host tries to spoof and use the ip address of another host any ip traffic coming into the interface with a source ip address other than that assigned via dhcp or static configuration will be filtered out on the untrusted layer 2 ports in order to apply these security measures we first need to log into our switch 1. it's important to make sure we are in advanced mode in our example our vlans are already created we will need to create our layer 3 port click on vlan management and navigate to interface settings next we'll choose the port that will make a layer 3 port in this example that's port 12. click on edit and choose layer 3 for switchboard mode click apply now we'll need to add an ip address to the layer 3 port click on ipv4 configuration under ipv4 interface click on add and then choose a port that was selected to be a layer 3 port choose static ip address and enter the ip address enter the network mask and then click apply the layer 3 port now has a static ip address what we need to do now is add routes to our switch so we can have communication between switch 1 and switch 2. click on ipv4 static routes and then add we will enter the ip range of the networks we want to reach in this example that's 10.15.120.0 with a network mask of 255.255.255 route type is remote in this example we will enter the ip address of switch to layer 3 port click apply next we will enter a static route for switch to vlan 10 quite like what we did before now we'll configure our switch too here we will configure our layer 3 port and our static routes to switch 1. are you having some deja vu i know i am on switch 2 we will configure our layer 3 port and we will add our static routes to reach switch 1. once we have configured our layer 3 port and added our static routes we will enable dhcp snooping and dhcp relay click on ipv4 configuration then on dhcp snooping click on properties here we can enable dhcp relay in dhcp snooping and we will enter the ip address of our dhcp server remember to click apply click on interface settings and here we'll enter the vlan 10 interface we'll enable dhcp relay for this vlan next we will click on dhcp snooping trusted interface click on the port that is a layer 3 port where the dhcp traffic will pass through click on edit under trusted interface and choose yes [Music] next we will configure the dhcp snooping binding database databases can be generated dynamically but in this example we will create an entry for port 20 manually by entering our device information for the vlan id mac address of our device as well as the ip address we'll then enter the interface of our port for type choose static and for this example we will enter a lease time as infinite click apply we've now bonded our port 20 to the above settings next we will configure ipsourceguard on properties and enable ipsourceguard we'll click on interface settings we see the port we configured earlier in our dhcp snooping binding database is set as ipsourceguard enabled and there you have it we demonstrated some advanced configurations that provided extra security to our network turning simplicity into security thanks

you don't miss an employee birthday sorry jeff to be in sync you'll have to configure your network switch in this cisco tech talk we're going to configure and sync system time in our cisco business 250 and 350 series switches using a simple network time protocol server in unicast mode next first we'll log into the switch providing the username and password then click on the login button once we're logged into the switch head to the upper right drop-down where it says basic and change it to advanced on this switch currently the latest firmware version 3.1.0.57 is installed under the system summary option we can verify this now to configure the time settings on this switch we'll navigate to the administration menu under the time settings menu we'll select the system time option here we can see that under clock source settings main clock source sntp server option is enabled this needs to be enabled so that it can sync the time from any sntp server the actual time from smtp server is showing along with the date and time zone offset we can also see the last synchronized server is reflecting here the mode is showing unicast and stratum level is showing one the stratum level defines the distance from a reference clock source if we look at the manual settings we can see that under time zone settings we have two options to get the time zone via dhcp or we can select the time zone offset manually from the drop down menu we'll need to make sure that we are selecting the correct time zone as per our location and we'll need to specify the time zone acronym as well we also have the option to configure daylight savings settings let's enable that and select the appropriate daylight saving time based on the region if we don't need this setting we can just uncheck the checkbox once we finalize the settings on this page we can click apply to save the settings let's move on to the sntp unicast page we need to make sure that the sntp client unicast is enabled the main clock source sntp server must be enabled for sntp client unicast to operate we can see that main clock source sntp servers is currently enabled and we can also see that ipv4 source interface and ipv6 source interface are set to auto we can select the ipv4 source vlan interface and ipv6 source vlan interface from the drop down menu under the unicast sntp server table we can see multiple servers are added apart from the default one and the server is successfully syncing the time also stratum levels are showing for their respective smtp servers click on the add button to add the sntp server on this page we'll need to select the server definition either by ip address or by name we'll select name for this example next we'll need to enter the sntp server domain name we'll enable the poll interval and we'll click the apply button to save our changes when we close the window we can see that the newly added sntp server is reflecting here on the page now the sntp servers added on this page are fully qualified domain names we'll need to make sure from this switch that we can resolve those domain names in order to do that we need to confirm the dns settings or domain name system settings are enabled on this switch to verify that go to the general ipconfiguration menu and select the dns settings option under the dns menu here we can see that dns settings are currently enabled holding retries pulling time out and polling interval are configured with default parameters under the dns server table we can see the dns server is learning via dhcp ipv4 in vlan1 interface we can also add the dns server under dns server table here to do this we'll click on the add button then we need to select ipversion either version 6 or version 4. we'll choose version 4 and we'll enter the dns server ip address so in this case we are entering the cisco umbrella dns server and we'll need to select the preference from the drop down menu to add another dns server again we'll select version 4 and we'll specify the cisco umbrella dns server again for the preference select two this time and click on apply now we'll close the window and we can see that the newly added dns servers are reflecting on the dns server table to save the settings on this switch we'll click this blinking floppy disk sign at the top of our screen we'll then navigate to the time settings page then system time and see that it is now synchronized through a different sntp server mode is showing unicast and stratum level is showing three in case we need to bring the sntp server details to the default settings then we need to navigate to sntp unicast page under time settings and click on the restore default servers option we will click ok on the confirmation pop-up window now we can see that only default sntp servers are reflecting under the unicast smtp server table we can also see that system time is now synchronized with a different sntp server [Music] now we're in sync now you know how to configure the system time on a cisco business 250 or 350 series switch thanks for watching this cisco tech talk we'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "i don't know about you but i can't remember the last time my phone wasn't by my side and not because i was waiting for a call my phone's like a wizard full of magical apps i can track my workout drive somewhere new open my garage turn on my lights and adjust my thermostat all that power in the palm of my hands now my phone can perform a new trick using the cisco business mobile app this app can make setup and management of my network a simple task before i get started it's important to note that the devices i use with the app are new or factory reset cisco business switches and wireless access points other devices can run on the network but they cannot be managed from the application in future releases new features new cisco business devices and more configuration options will be added that's what's great about apps they're always being updated and improved in this tech talk i'll use the cisco business mobile app to do the initial setup and configuration of cisco business switches and wireless access points next i've downloaded the app on my phone and my devices are plugged into my network so i'm ready to roll i'll add a site and set up the configuration i want on my network devices the application will discover my cisco business devices and apply the configuration settings to start i'll open the cisco business mobile app the first thing that pops up is the option to create your first site where i'll name my network and set a location i'll click add site in the upper right hand corner of the screen next i'll tap on get started the app uses location services to determine my address i need to enter a name for the site i'll name my site lab when i scroll down i can see my location if the address is incorrect or i need to make changes i could tap inside of here and edit as needed i'll just go ahead and tap next the setup wizard is going to prompt me for site credentials these are the credentials for the site not for the application i'll put in the username i want my devices to use and then enter a password you may notice that the next button is not illuminated it will stay that way until the password and password confirmation match to show that i'll add an extra character to my password once they don't match the next button is dimmed until i remove that extra character i'll select next and i'm brought to the summary screen if i needed to make any changes i could tap on edit and make changes as needed everything looks good to me so i'll go ahead and tap on add site the site has been added so i'll click done time for the exciting part getting our gear set up i'll move on to setting the site configuration by tapping start site configuration then i'll tap get started the first question is regarding wireless do i want the application to configure a wireless network in this example i have a cbw ap that's ready to be configured so i'll be doing the wireless setup it should be noted that if i had an ap that either wasn't supported by the app such as a wab 581 or web 125 i could use those to connect into my network i just can't configure or manage them from the app if this is your situation connect them to the cisco business switch select no and continue the network configuration for the wired network in this case i have a cisco business ap so i'll answer yes the next question asks if i want to set up multiple networks you can think of this as being like multiple vlans where traffic is separated into different groups for example you may not want guest network users to be able to access devices containing your sensitive information such as banking or accounting for this demonstration i'm just going to say one is fine i'm directed to the advanced settings page which includes setting up a domain name system dns network time protocol ntp and dynamic host configuration protocol also known as dhcp optionally i can do them on my own and manually configure them but in this case i'll select do it automatically i'll tap continue since i only have one network i'll enter the network id as one i'm going to enter the name lab and then select next moving right along it's time for my wireless setup on my screen you will see a plus symbol if i click on that i could add another wireless network i'm going to go ahead and delete that one since i only want to run one wireless network it's going to show type as employee i'll enter my passphrase and then select next and next one more time i'm presented with a summary of the settings that i've entered if i needed to make a change i could tap on edit and make changes to the network segment which would be the wired network or the wireless it all looks good so i'll tap confirm site configuration and then done i'll select add devices and then get started this will get me connected to my network to configure my devices since i previously configured the app to do a wireless setup it's going to want to connect to cisco business setup this is the current ssid which is the default name of the network i'll tap join it's now connected to the ssid i'll tap done it's going to perform device discovery on that ssid here it sees my access point which is a 145 ac i'll tap add it shows me a summary of the settings that would be applied i'll confirm add device and now it's going to configure that access point this will take several minutes now that it's configured the access point the mobile app wants to join the wireless network lab i'll tap on join this may take a few minutes once the confirmation of deployment appears i'll see the option to add other devices this is a great option but instead of choosing that i want to show you a different way to deploy your devices so i will select done this brings me to the main page for my site from here i will show you the other way to add devices i'll select add devices go to get started and it will detect the cisco business devices that are out there nice i can see that it found three cisco business switches on my network i have a cbs250 220 and 350. i'll go ahead and scroll down to the bottom of the page and then tap on add these three devices it's going to show me which devices are going to be added and then i'll click to add and deploy devices it will start configuring those switches since these switches are either brand new or have been factory reset they're ready for initial configuration once it is complete i'll click done just like that my network is up and running no magic spells required from this point on i can manage these cisco business devices all from the app on my phone thanks for watching this tech talk i'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "have you ever wanted to be a detective digging into clues and pursuing every angle to solve the case it must be exciting to eliminate possible suspects and find the culprit well watson just call me sherlock and grab your magnifying glass my wireless network is having problems and needs help come along for the ride it'll be excellent in this episode of cisco tech talk i'll explore several troubleshooting options to get my wireless network back on track and you will too i'll start with verifying some physical and environmental conditions first i'll check is all the equipment turned on that includes the access point mesh extender and any other device which is present in the cisco business wireless is the link light glowing consistently if it's green that's a good sign are the cables connected correctly check the cable connectivity am i facing a local area network connectivity issue i'll need to check if the cable is properly connected could it be a bad cable am i facing a speed and duplex negotiation issue you should check the cable that may be the issue is the equipment overheating if the access point or mesh extender is not performing properly it can be caused by the overheating of the device make sure your devices are kept in a controlled temperature and work fine could it be an environmental factor such as where it's located are the devices located near any other wireless or other devices which may be causing interference within the 2.4 and 5 gigahertz network we need to consider those factors as well are there any metal or thick walls between the access point and the wireless device this can disrupt the wireless signal by weakening the signal if the client is completely unable to connect maybe it's due to the client being out of range if the wireless client is out of the ap's coverage area it won't connect since the client may be trying to connect to a specific ap next i'll log into cisco business wireless access point and see what other troubleshooting we can perform click login to log into the cisco business wireless access point enter the username and password click sign in to log into the cisco business wireless network once i log into the cisco business wireless primary ap under network summary in the main menu i can see the lan indicators for the default gateway ip or management interface here i can check the intranet indicator to see if the public dns 8.8.8.8 is within range the wireless indicators check the wireless connectivity by looping through all access points within the networks both the networks a and b are enabled if a network is down in any of the aps the wireless status is considered to be down otherwise the wireless indicator is operational i'll click clients available under the monitoring menu to troubleshoot the connection issue with the wireless client i can check the logging level for notifications and the logs in the primary ap under management and logging section [Music] next in the monitoring menu i'll click clients to check the details once the client is visible i can see the different parameters for that client such as signal strength connection speed client types mac address connected wlans and the duration of the connection i can click on this client to troubleshoot any connectivity issues if i scroll down this client view page then i'll be able to see the ping test option click start to check the latency and reachability between the primary ap and the client this displays the latency you can see that the client is reachable with a 5 out of 5 attempt success rate in the connection tab i can perform a connection test i may choose to perform a connection test when the client fails to connect to a particular wlan this test takes about three minutes i'll attempt to connect during the three minute test while it generates diagnostic information to help in the troubleshooting i'll click start to enable the client debugging i'll click ok and wait for three minutes then i'll click stop to get the client test diagnostics now the event log testing contains the time stamp and message details that are exchanged between the client and the access point the message type helps to analyze and conclude if a client is able to successfully join a wlan i'll click on start to start the process and then i can stop it and save the report to a local system i'll click ok to save the report to a local system now i'll click on access points available under monitoring to see the troubleshooting options available i can select any of the access points in this case i'll select this mesh extender and see what the troubleshooting options are i can see the access point parameters [Music] i'll scroll down the page to check if the tech support option is available i can start the process to get the tech support bundle i'll click ok and the tech support status is showing in progress once the status is completed i'll click on download to get the tech support file i can save that file this is a compressed file so i'll need to extract that file to see the details i'll click ok to save the file using any zip application i can open the compressed file to check the details within this troubleshooting file on this access point page i can see the client's options if any client is associated with that access point then it will be displayed here under this mesh extender it's not showing but i can see that under any other access point it will be visible so i can see that on this ap one client is associated here the rf troubleshooting option displays a visual graphical representation of the parameters that can affect the access point's radio performance spectrum intelligence by default is visible in order to reduce the cpu cycles and increase the performance of the cisco business wireless i can enable spectrum intelligence from the advanced rf optimizing parameter under tools i can enable or disable ap led blink led import or export the config or transfer the firmware or image the restart ap and factory default options are not available on the primary ap i can verify that by going to the access point where i can see that this is a master primary ap so i'll click on that [Music] and under tools i can see that the restart and reboot options are reset and the reboot option is not available i can reboot or reset the access point using those two options next i'll navigate to the advanced menu to see rf optimization menu and check the rf optimization parameters i'll move that slide bar to the right to enable the rf optimization to maximize the wi-fi network performance i can optimize the rf signals coverage in quality now i can see that the rf automation client density is showing as low [Music] by default the medium client density based rf setting is applied now we can see the traffic type applicable here from the drop down i can see traffic type either data or voice and data so i'll keep this as data using the expert view i can see more parameters and i can click on switch to expert view and navigate to the expert view [Music] here i can see the various parameters which influence the cisco business wireless network performance such as the 2.4 gigahertz optimized roaming and 5 gigahertz optimized roaming to enable the 2.4 gigahertz optimized roaming and 5 gigahertz optimized roaming i need to move the slide bar to the right optimize roaming resolves the problems of the sticky clients associated with access points that are located far away and outbound clients that attempt to connect to a wi-fi network without a stable connection roaming allows the client to disassociate based on the rssi of the client data packets and data rate optimized roaming also prevents a client association when the client's rssi is low by checking the incoming client's rssi against the rssi threshold thus if any wireless client is facing a connectivity issue i can check the spam filters on the cisco business wireless i can see the and 5 gigahertz intervals the interval range is between 5 to 90 seconds 90 is the default value if i configure a low reporting interval the network can be overloaded with coverage report messages if the interval is set to a value other than the 90 seconds then the client statistics will be sent only during the failure cases i can see that 2.4 gigahertz threshold and 5 gigahertz threshold options are currently set as disable however i can set the default parameter from the drop down for 2.4 and 5 gigahertz [Music] the client will get disassociated if the current data rate of the client is lower than the optimized roaming data rate threshold so i'll keep that as disable for now so if any of the threshold is defined the client is not able to reach it i can see the event driven rrm radio resource management which is currently enabled this toggle allows an ap in distress to bypass normal radio resource management intervals and immediately change the channel this is a global setting and can be enabled or disabled for this event driven rrm i can move the slide bar to enable now the interfere detection is currently disabled i can move the slide bar to enable that this is a global setting which enables the primary ap to detect the non-wi-fi sources by default it's disabled so i'll keep it as disabled the 5 gigahertz channel width is currently set as 20 megahertz i can select the different channel bandwidth from the drop down menu the channel bandwidth option controls how broad the signal is for transferring data such as 20 megahertz 40 megahertz 80 megahertz or best by increasing the channel bandwidth i can increase the speed and throughput of a wireless broadcast this global setting is set to best by default so i'll keep that then i can see that 2.4 and 5 gigahertz data rates option are currently set at a lower density for both 2.4 and 5 gigahertz networks if i increase that then the legacy devices will not be able to connect if i move it to 12 ups then 802.11 b devices are not supported same is for five gigahertz network if i enable or enhance that value then some legacy devices are not supported so i need to check this parameter if a legacy device or legacy client is not able to associate it to our wireless network that whether these parameters are enabled on 2.4 or 5 gigahertz networks or not then the final parameter on these pages selects dca channels this is the child dynamic channel assignment i can select or click individual channels to be included in dca for 2.4 and 5 gigahertz band a green underline below the channel number indicates that it's selected i can click on that to unselect it once i finalize the configuration then i can click apply to save the settings it will show a notification on the screen and i'll click yes to continue [Music] on the primary ap tools page available under the advanced menu i can see the primary ap troubleshooting tools by clicking on restrict primary ap i can restart the primary ap if i'm still facing any issues then i need to reboot i can perform it from here or the configuration management tab [Music] i can either download or upload the configuration via http sftp or ftp or tftp method and i can see the restore to factory default settings if i need to bring our access point to the default settings i can click reset to factory default settings and bring that to the default configuration under the troubleshooting file tab i can download the tech support i did that initially from the access point menu so from here also i can download the tech support bundle and by the ftp method and http method i can select the transfer mode and click on apply settings under the troubleshooting tools i can see the various options available like ssh v2 access by default this ssh is visible for all aps connected to the cisco business wireless network ssh can be enabled by the cisco technical support team for debugging process now the dns servers is showing the cisco umbrella and probably dns like 8.8.8.8 i can choose that dns server from the dropdown i can choose either umbrella or i can specify any new dns server i need to enter the dns server follow-up if i want to use a specific dns server for our network or device i then can apply that here then i can use the ping test tool to check the reachability of a client or any domain here i can ping any ip this is a public dns ip that i can ping i can click start and i can see the ping test result here i can also check the dns status i can click start to verify that cisco.com is a valid one dns and its radius response tools operate like a simulation tool to verify if the primary ap can reach the radius server it also verifies the username and password that are present in radius server next i'll enter the user details and password and click start to verify to clear the parameters click clear so that will clear the test parameters to default elementary my dear watson i have solved the case and my wireless network is as good as new it's time for this gum shoe to put down the magnifying glass and get back to work thanks for watching [Music]",

    "transcript": "during award season i have one party after another you know how it is at each exclusive party the bouncer makes sure i'm on the guest list before i'm allowed in it keeps the party private and secure a radius server acts like a bouncer it regulates access to the network by verifying the identity of the users through the login credentials entered the radius server checks the passwords entered by the users in grants or denies access in this episode of cisco tech talk i'll demonstrate how to configure rv340 series routers to authenticate ltp vpn connection user logins with a radius server on windows 2019 server standard edition today i'll be using a windows network policy server nps as my radius server alongside windows active directory users and computers cisco only supports the configuration on the rv340 series routers and does not support the configuration of the windows server 2019 standard edition or its many tools i'll log into my router and navigate to the vpn then ipsec profiles here i'll create the ipsec profiles for the lttp vpn server i'll click plus and enter a name in profile name for this example i'm going to call it l to tp i'll leave the default settings on phase 1 options to group 2 3 des i'll change authentication to sha 1 and set the essay lifetime to the 86400 i'll leave the phase two protocol selection to esp encryption three does and change authentication to sha one and change the essay lifetime to two eight eight zero zero i'll disable perfect forward secrecy and click apply to save i now have my l to tp ipsec profile next i'll go to lttp server and click on i'm going to leave mtu size at 1400 and set an ip range for the devices that are connecting this is just a range of ip addresses in the same subnet for this example i'll set the start ip address to 10.0.0.1 and my end ip address to 10.0.0.1 next i'll add out local dns server in the dns 1ip address you can also add a secondary if you have one for now i'm going to leave my user authentication blank i'll add that later check on for the ipsec profile and change the ipsec profile to l2tp next i'll add my pre-shared key cisco123 and click enable to show pre-shared key and then click apply [Music] i'll navigate to system configuration and user groups here i'll add a new user group for my l to tpv vpn connection click on the plus button and enter vpn users for the user group i'll scroll down to verify that l2tp is permitted and click apply my vpn users group is here and lttp is enabled now let's talk about how the router is going to interact with the nps server on windows i see the vpn users group that i created i'll enter a name for global and security under users i have one user and it's a member of the vpn users group next select allow access in the dial-in tab now i'll go over to my network policy server make sure that i have registered my network policy server with my active directory so that it knows to authenticate using the users from active directory in radius clients i'll need to add a client i'll name it rv340 give it an ip address enable it and then set a pre-shared key in this case i've used a manual pre-shared key this will have to match so i recommend copying this pre-shared key and pasting it into the router side next under network policies i'll create a policy for lttp to authenticate with and name it allow rv340l to tp for granting access the type of network access server can be unspecified under conditions i'll select the windows groups and an nis ipv4 address which is the router's ip address in my constraints i'm going to set up my authentication methods in this case i have ms chap version 2 ms chap and chap enabled under settings i'll need to add a class and specify the vpn user group that was created on the router in this case i created vpn users now i'm back on my router side and i'm going to configure the router to use the nps server from windows with radius i'll select radius under user accounts and click edit first i'll enter the ip address of the radius server which is 172.19.76.2 [Music] and i'm using port 1645 this is where i enter my pre-shared key again i recommend copying and pasting the pre-shared key to make sure this is correct it needs to be a very difficult pass key which can be auto-generated from the windows sometimes the rv340 will not accept a pre-generated key because it doesn't accept certain characters you may have to modify it if it's generated from the windows server i'll go ahead and click apply to save the changes my radius server is enabled and is pointing to the server ip address now i need to make sure that ltp server is using radius for its primary now that i've completed all that i'll click apply to save the changes next i'll click on the flashing red disk icon to save the changes on the router this redirects to the configuration management under administration next for my sources i'll select running configuration and for destination select startup configuration then i'll click apply this is successful i'll see the flashing red disk has disappeared telling me that there are no current settings changes in my running configuration that don't match my startup configuration now in internet and network settings i'll select the vpn option to create my vpn client on the windows client i'll click add and select windows vpn i'll enter a name for the connection i'm going to use lttp to office my server name is the wan ip address of my router in most cases it's going to be a public ip address you could also use a dynamic dns here i'll use my dynamic dns and enter in my domain name i'm going to select my vpn type which is l2tp over ipsec with pre-shared key i'll enter the same pre-shared that i entered on the router which was cisco123 i do recommend that once you've tested this is working change the pre-share key to something very difficult even do an auto-generated if possible so that nobody can guess it i'm going to use a type of sign-in info username and password you can select to remember type of sign-in info or do it every time you try to connect in this case i'll enter the username for my active directory server and click the password i'll click save and see that my connection name is here now i'll attempt to connect to my vpn that i've just created i'll right click internet options and select lttp to office connection and click connect it's now requesting that we enter my login credentials and now i'm connected [Music] at this point i should be able to bring up my router i see that i'm connected here under vpn vpn status i can scroll down to my ltp connection and see that user brazu from remote ip using tunnel ip is connected at any given time if i see something i don't like i can click this action disconnect and it will break the connection you can see i've been disconnected now so if i refresh this page i will not be able to reach the router i've opened wireshark a tool i used to verify that my connection is active or to troubleshoot a connection that's inactive during authentication here i have the request from the router to the server i can scroll up or down to see the data that is being sent to the server to verify my next radius packet is the access accept a radius server is accepting the credentials and allowing the ltp connection to occur another tool i can use is the windows event viewer i have it opened here to the windows logs and security option i've chosen the log here you can see that it was created when i authenticated earlier to my lttp connection i can see that brazoo user was the username as i scroll down i can see the public ip that it came from i see the nas identifier that i entered in the policy i also see the friendly name and the ip address of the router that was created for the radius client on the mps server i can see that it did hit my network policy that's one thing you want to check if it's not working and down here the log results would give you any indication as to why the client did not authenticate in this case it's just writing to the local log file that it occurred [Music] awesome my network is now private and secure just like my party tonight exclusive access is limited to those on the guest list i better run it's time for my glam squad to get started before my next party tonight thanks for watching i'll see you next time [Music] you",

episode of cisco tech talks i'm going to show you how easy it is to configure a switch port through cisco business dashboard first i'll log into the cisco business dashboard with my username and password and then click the log in button once i'm logged in i need to check the version so i'll click on the little icon on the right hand side of the screen and in this case the version is 2.3.0 next i'll open the menu option on the left side of the screen and click on port management when i open the port management page i can see all the switch ports that are deployed in my network the model number and serial number of each switch port is displayed above it to start the process of configuring a switch port i'm going to click on it like this when i've selected it i can see the configuration details in the panel on the right side of the screen in this case the gi-1 port is selected on the cbs 250 8fp e2g switch now let's scroll down the screen to see what we can configure for this switch port here in the general tab i can see the mac address duplex and other settings for this switch port and this is where i can enable or disable this port i can simply click on the edit button and then select the check box next to enabled or disabled for right now i'll leave this checked as enabled when i'm done if i made any changes i must save them so i'll click on the floppy disk icon which i'll call the save icon from here on i can also configure the speed and duplex setting for this switch port here now click on the edit button in the ethernet tab and then i can select the speed from the drop down menu the options here are 10 100 1000 or auto for now i'll keep it set to auto i can also select an option from the duplex drop down menu the options are half full and auto again i won't make any changes and we'll keep this set as auto but i'm still going to click on the save icon i should see a notification on the top of the screen that says ethernet configuration was saved successfully and a job created to apply it to the device this is a good reminder that i was successful at making any updates if i need to this is where i can select and add a new vlan for this port the first thing i'll practice here is how to select a vlan to start with i'll scroll down to the vlan tab and then click on the select vlan option next to vlan setting the window that opens next has a list of all the trunk vlans in this port i'll select the vlan that i want and then click the arrow in the center to move it to the right hand column and then i need to click the save button this will create the job and at the top of the screen again i'll see a notification that the vlan configuration was saved successfully and a job created to apply it to the device at this point i can look at the trunk vlan field and see the vlan that i just edited i can also create a new vlan to do this i'll click on the create vlan option and then enter a vlan id and vlan name in the pop-up window so enter 20 in the vlan id field then enter vlan 20 in the vlan name field [Music] note that there are two check boxes in the window and that i need to pick one they are create on all devices in the same group and create on all devices in the organization you can select either one but for this example i'm going to click on the check box create on all devices in the same group and then click the save button this job will be created and again at the top of the screen i can see the notification that the vlan 20 creation job successfully created when i'm all done i can now see the id of the vlan i just created in the trunk vlan field next to the vlan i selected earlier i can configure the power over ethernet settings here to do that i'll first click on the edit icon in the poe tab to see what the poa priority options are for this port when i click on the drop down menu i'll see what options are there if i choose critical this priority class always receives power what this means is if there is not enough power to use on all the ports then the ports assigned in this class are prioritized if i select high it receives power only if all critical priority ports are receiving power if i select low this port receives power only if all critical priority and high priority ports are receiving power right now there isn't a poe schedule configured for this port but if any had been this is where i would select it from the drop down menu here [Music] now here is where i can select the toggle power for the port all i need to do is click the toggle power button and once again i can see the notification on the top of the screen that says toggle the poe power successfully now that i'm finished with the poe settings i'll click on the floppy disk icon again to save the configuration now in this panel i can configure my green ethernet settings to start i need to click the edit icon now i can see that eee enable is already checked when this option is turned on there will be less power consumption during periods of low data activity in the network the other option i see here is short reach i can enable this by clicking the check box and then i can run the links with less power than i normally use one thing to remember here is that i can't enable short reach and eee enable at the same time if i need to turn on short reach then i must turn off the eee enable option for this episode i'll keep the ee enable option checked and finally this is where i can configure settings for smart ports the smart port settings panel is where i determine what devices can connect to this particular switchboard right now i can see that auto smart port is selected for this gi 1 switch port based on the devices that are currently connected to this switchboard it looks like i can select other smart port settings like a printer desktop or server in this case i'll select server again i'll see the notification at the top of the screen that the smart port config was saved successfully and a job created to apply it to the device which means the server has been selected now you've seen how simple it is to configure switch ports from the port management window using cisco business dashboard keep it simple and smart you've got this thanks for watching we'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "if you've driven through a large city you may have been able to avoid a lot of traffic by taking an hov lane these lanes are reserved for high occupancy vehicles essentially if you have three or more people in your car you can take a less congested road to get to your destination on a network some traffic needs top priority to avoid congestion on its way to its destination too voice and video are key examples of traffic that needs to be prioritized in this episode of cisco tech talk i'll show you how to configure a wlan using a dstp qos rewrite on a cisco rv340 series router before we start let me explain what qos and dstp stand for qos means quality of service and this is used to optimize network traffic and improve the overall experience in other words qos controls and manages the resources in a network by setting priorities for specific types of data dstp stands for differentiated services code point and it's used to classify and manage the traffic on my network so today i'm going to use these tools to pick a type of service or traffic and then make it a higher priority on the wlan interface where the traffic comes in and out i'm going to start by opening the web interface for my router this is the main screen for my router so i'm going to click system configuration on the left panel then select service management for this example i'm going to create a new service to show the steps going forward first thing is to click the plus icon at the top of the window to open a new screen where i'll add my new device so here we are now i need to enter the name of this device in this box in this case i'll enter it as a phone service that i can find easily so i'll enter the name like this phone service underscore rtp underscore udp underscore 5062 next i'll select udp from the protocol dropdown menu i'll enter 5062 in the port start and also in the port end fields i need to click apply to save this new device the next step is to assign a class to my new device again on the left side of the window i'll select qos and then select traffic classes to open the next window okay i'll create the new traffic class here first i'll give it a name and enter phone service i'm not going to enter a description in the next field but you can if you want under the service table i'm going to click the plus icon which will let me add this new class in the first field i'll enter phone service now everything you see here are the default settings but i'm going to make some changes i'll select ipv4 in the ip version drop down menu now i need to select the service application type of traffic for this device i'll pick phone service underscore rtp underscore udp underscore 5062 that i just created for the dstp rewrite option i'll select 46e f ef stands for expedited forwarding and dscp is marked with 46. once more i'll click apply at the top of the screen to save this traffic class now i'm going to open the wan queueing window from the left pane at the top of the screen i can see three different queuing engine options priority rate control and low latency i'll check the box to select low latency low latency is a feature developed by cisco that allows me to put more priority over certain data traffic in my network in other words low latency allows data that is delay sensitive like voice to be prioritized over other traffic i'll click the plus icon which opens a new screen where i can do more configuring for this example i'll leave the policy name and description fields with their default settings farther down the screen i'll now make some updates in the queuing low latency table here is where i'll set the priority of the traffic class in the first row first i'll click the drop down menu for traffic class and then i'll select phone service that i entered a little while ago now i'll click apply again to save this update on this screen i can see that the policy i just created is not applied to a wan so i'll do it here and apply the changes i made to my wan one i'll select the check box for the policy i just created called low latency untitled then i'll click on the edit icon now to select the wan i can click on this blue link named wan bandwidth management or select it from the panel on the left to open the window i need on this page i'll select the drop down menu under outbound queueing policy on the line for win1 i'll select the low latency untitled that i just created and then press apply my network can now run efficiently giving priority to what matters most thanks for watching i'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "if you're setting up a cisco business 350 switch and have decided to use a windows 2019 server you've come to the right place but before we go further it's important to note that cisco does not support third-party applications and services this example is shown for demonstration purposes only since a windows server can be used with cisco business 350 series switches in this episode of cisco tech talk i'll show you how to manage your radius settings on a windows 2019 server with a cbs 350 switch and 802.1x client [Music] today i'll show the network topology overview of the 802.1x client the radius client and the radius server i'll use my network policy and access services or npas settings to provide authentication for 802.1x client to an authenticator i'll show the settings on the windows server settings on the switch and the windows 10 client [Music] it may sound confusing but by the end of this video you will see how easy it is to do this screen here is the network topology layout using graphics first on the left i start with the supplicant because it's seeking access to the network resources the 802.1x client is a pc that uses windows 10 enterprise operating system next is the authenticator or the radius client which is a cbs 350 switch this is the authenticator that controls the network access it has an ip address of 172. [Music] these are connected via the lan to the authentication server or the radius server which is configured on a windows 2019 server its ip address is 172. now that i've shown you the overview of how everything works together i'll look at some of the settings the windows 2019 server has already been configured as an active directory domain controller the radius or npas server feature has been enabled on the local server menu here i can see that the ethernet ip is 172.16.1. and the operating system is microsoft windows server 2019 on the npas menu i'll look at the server and confirm the ip address is 172.16.1.4 now i'll open the network policy server settings i'll click on radius clients and servers on the left panel and under that i'll select radius clients to see what switches are enabled for this network on the settings tab i see the cbs 350 switch has been added as a radius client then on the advanced tab i see the name of the vendor which in this case is cisco now i'll close this window and then go to the left panel and click on the connection request policies option under the policies menu if i double-click secure wired ethernet connections it opens a new window and in the overview tab i can see that policy state has been enabled [Music] under the conditions tab i see that the condition is set to nas port type the settings tab displays all the default settings now back in the network policies menu i see that the policy named secure wired ethernet connections is enabled for this server when i double click on it i can see the settings for this policy under the overview tab i can see that the policy state has been enabled i can also see that access permission has been set to grant access under the conditions tab i see that the nasport type condition shows ethernet as the media type [Music] under the constraints tab i see that microsoft encrypted authentication version 2 has also been selected eap types are shown here on this window now i'll click on the settings tab and see that under attributes frame protocol is ppp and service type is framed i'll exit this window and open the local server settings again but this time i'll click on the tasks drop down on the right side of the screen i'll click on the active directory users and computers and then click managed service accounts this screen shows the active directory users and computers and i see that cisco lab is listed here as user when i double click on cisco lab it opens another window showing me all the properties for this user here i see the first and last name are cisco lab and the display name is a combination of the two now i'll click on the account tab to see the user logon name when i select the dial-in tab it shows me that the network access permission has been set to allow access under the remote control tab i can see that enable remote control has been selected and so it's enabled as well now i'll click on the tab called member of and check that it's a member of the domain users that was shown in the account tab after looking and checking all the settings in the server manager i'll log into my switch to configure the required settings first i'll log in with my username and password now that i've logged in the first thing i need to do is change the mode from basic to advanced in the top right corner of the screen this is how i get the options that i need to configure the switch i need to click on system summary under status and statistics in the left panel and confirm that my firmware version is up to date in this case it's 3.1.1.7 now i'll open the security menu and select the radius client option on this page i'm going to set the radius accounting to port based access control 802.1x mac based web authentication and i'll keep the rest of the configuration with the default settings now at the bottom of the page in the radius table i'm going to click on the plus icon to add a new radius server i'll add the details on the add radius server page i'll keep the buttons that are already selected here to add the server definition by ip address and the ip version will stay as version 4. [Music] next in the server ip address name field i'll enter the ip address that we saw earlier it will be 172.16.1.4 and then i'll enter one as the priority next i'll change the key string setting to user define plain text and then enter the key string into the field i won't change any other settings on this page now i'll click apply to save this configuration and i should see the notification at the top of the screen that it was successful when i click the close button i can see the server i just configured is now added to the radius table back on the radius client page now i'll open the 802.1x authentication option from the left panel next i'll select the properties page first thing i need to do is enable the port-based authentication all the other settings here will stay the same so again i'll click the apply button i should see the success notification at the top of this screen when it's done and successful now i'll select the port authentication page where i'm going to select the port number where the windows 10 client is going to connect on this page i'll select the switch port 2 under the port authentication table and then click the edit button at the top on this page i'll change the setting for administrative port control to auto then i need to check and make sure that 802.1x based authentication is also checked and enabled i'll keep the other parameters here set to the default and then click the apply button once again i can close this window when i see the notification at the top of the window that this was successful back in this window i can see that the port authentication table now shows that administrative port control is now set to auto for switch port number two next i'll open the vlan management page and then select the port vlan membership page where i can see the vlan mapping on that port that i just configured i see that ge2 interface is set to access mode and vlan 1 is allowed on that switch port now the final step is to configure the windows 10 client to do that i need to open the run option on that system using the start menu or by pressing the windows and r button together on the keyboard i'll enter services.msc in this field and then click ok in the services window i'll scroll down the page and double click on wired auto config this opens the window where i can check and make sure all the settings are what i want everything looks good startup type is selected as automatic so now i'll click ok to exit this window now i need to configure the network interface card back in the run command window i'll enter mcpa.cpl and click ok this opens the network properties window where i can double-click on the ethernet interface to open a new window under the authentication tab i'll make sure that enable ieee 802.1x authentication is checked i'll also click on the settings button here to make sure that enable fast reconnect is also checked but first i need to make sure that the network authentication method is secured password eap-ms-chappy2 also i need to make sure that the check box next to verify the server's identity by validating the certificate is not checked i'll click ok now i'll click the additional settings button now to open the advanced settings tab for the 802.1x i need to make sure that specify authentication mode is enabled in the drop down menu under specify authentication mode i need to make sure that user authentication is selected then i'll disable the checkbox for enable single sign-on for this network now i'll click ok and then ok again to close these screens my windows 10 system will get connected to the ge2 port where it will then get the username and password authentication prompt with the username and admin password my system will be authenticated [Music] to save this configuration i just need to click the save icon at the top of the page this is how i configured my windows server 2019 radius settings with a cbs 350 switch and 802.1x client if this configuration is right for you it's your turn thanks for watching i'll see you next time [Music] you",

    "transcript": "when you first set up your office you created your own local area network a lan a lan needs an internet service provider isp modem and a router to get access to the internet once you connected at least one computer or another device for internet access voila you had your own lan moving beyond that initial connection over time you may have added your own router switch computers phones security cameras or printers no matter how many devices are on your lan by default every end device is put into one big group called a broadcast domain by default all ports are put into vlan 1. all resources are shared and available within this group a single broadcast domain works fine in a small network but now that your company has grown you may want to separate traffic into virtual lands called vlans you won't see these separated networks but they may be just what you need in this episode of cisco tech talk i'll explain vlans and their benefits next to start i'll explain a little more about broadcast domains to give you a visual think of a switch like a mail room in an office building when you have one broadcast domain every time a switch receives a broadcast packet it sends the message out to everyone every mailbox besides where the message originated it's like spam everybody gets it whether it applies to the receiver or not if there are many messages sent out and getting flooded out to everyone this can be a burden on the switch or in my comparison that poor overworked mail room worker limiting broadcast messages to a smaller relevant group is important as there are many messages happening in the background of a network that you don't even see having separate broadcast domains can also keep information and resources restricted to those that require access it's like delivering sealed envelopes to certain mailboxes not intended for prying eyes for example you may have a server that you only want management to be able to access in another situation you may want the accounting server access available only to the accounting department this process is built in when vlans are in place another great benefit is that you can set up vlans and no one needs to move the location of their workspace since the separation is virtual the physical location doesn't matter this means that you can have people working in accounting sales and marketing scattered between different floors and you won't need to add any extra equipment to make it work beyond the general process of separating traffic on vlans you can further customize them you can allow one or more vlans to communicate with each other you can also add access from more than one vlan to a certain resource in your network like a server this is called inter vlan routing if you want to save your switch from having to use a separate switch port for each vlan you can set up trunk ports trunk ports carry the data of more than one vlan so when a message is sent it has a tag attached for a specific vlan this tells the switch where to send the traffic this is all done without you seeing any of these tags they are attached at arrival to the switch and then removed when they are sent to their destination like the mail room all that work is done behind the scenes in contrast access ports are ports that only carry traffic for one vlan if a port is configured as an access port it doesn't need to carry a tag to keep traffic differentiated in this case the port would be considered an access port that carries untagged traffic when you configure a vlan you assign switch ports to one or more vlans this is where you assign the ports as trunk or access as well as tagged or untagged instead of by department some vlans are set up to separate different types of traffic like voice and data some businesses even set up a guest vlan to keep that traffic independent from the rest you really can customize the vlans for whatever works best for you if you're ready to configure vlans on your network you can go to cisco.com click support and then enter your switch model from here you will find documentation on setting up vlans specific to your switch model in addition videos on vlan configuration can be found at www.video.cisco.com thanks for watching i'll see you next time [Music] you",

    "transcript": "today many businesses use a vpn a virtual private network if you need a vpn on your rv160 or 260 router and are hoping to keep things simple let's go in this episode of cisco tech talk i'll show you how to configure the rv160 or rv260 router to use openvpn with a password only for client authentication [Music] configuring an rv160 or rv 260 router to use openvpn with a password only for authentication is a simpler and faster method as opposed to using a certificate and password authentication what makes it less complicated there's no need to create a client certificate while utilizing password-only authentication to set up the router clients will authenticate using passwords however a certificate authority ca certificate and a router certificate are required for both methods before configuring the router a ca and a router certificate need to be generated to generate the first certificate click on administration certificate generate csr ca certificate as type and then a name choose fqdn for the subject alternative name this name can be ambiguous but the name must have a dot in it just finishing up the rest of the fields it's important to note that the common name must be the same as the subject alternative name following this choose a valid duration period and click generate to generate the certificate since a second certificate is needed the next step is to again select generate csr certificate and then certificate signed by a ca certificate as type from the drop-down list you need to enter a name for the certificate select fqdn as the subject's alternative name and give it a name following that the rest of the boxes need to get filled in don't forget the common name must match the subject alternative name for the certificate authority so choose the certificate that you already created earlier and enter a valid duration period moving along it's time to configure openvpn on the router select system configuration create a group give it a name click the on button for openvpn under services after making changes to the configurations it's important to click apply to save these new settings [Music] next click add under local users enter a username and then a password to create a new account this will be the client's password for the openvpn choose the group from the drop-down list that you created earlier if more clients need to be added to the vpn a username and password will need to be generated for them as well it's best practice to store the username and password type them in and then click apply navigating to user groups the group that was created is displayed when moving over to the user groups the newly created group has openvpn enabled next configure the openvpn settings by clicking vpn openvpn clicking enable and then selecting when as the interface remember the ca certificate authority that was created earlier it's time to use that confirm that the server certificate is the second certificate that was previously created next choose password only for the client authentication after that choose split tunnel which allows you to specify which networks you want to connect to via vpn split tunnels can be beneficial as they provide vpn access to certain networks on the router while denying access to the others split tunnels will also send the clients traffic through the vpn if it is destined for the defined networks all other traffic will be sent out to the client's default gateway now input the network address under ip address followed by the network mask to grant access to your router's network if there were more networks that were cleared for client access you could enter another ip address in addition a secondary dns could be added so for a backup insert the known google dns server and click apply next export the ovpn file by selecting export client configuration template click on generate confirm and then click the red blinking icon to save under configuration management save the running configuration to the startup configuration click that handy apply a button once again sometimes the rv router will be double netted behind a modem or a router if you are double netted there are a couple more steps to follow this can be checked by navigating to system summary then when and checking for an ip address if the ip address is private the router is double netted plan time for just a few added steps in your configuration if the ip address is public you can skip ahead if it is double matted find and open your ovpn file modify the ip address under remote and provide your public ip address because it is double netted you need to make sure that port forwarding is configured for port 1194 to the cisco rv router once this is confirmed save the changes to the file okay next configure the openvpn client to import the ovpn file that was exported from the rv router the router's public ip address should appear under the server hostname following this enter the username and password that was set up on the rb router once connect is clicked a pop-up message occurs click continue to connect the ovpn client that should do it openvpn is configured and connected to your

    "transcript": "have you ever heard the saying the only constant in life is change it's true change is inevitable and technology advancements are a prime example of that altering the face of the world and how we live in it when setting up or expanding your network even if you use the latest technology there are some traditional methods to follow to keep a good handle on your network configuration this includes documenting the topology of your network and strategically setting some static ip addresses where needed the safest way to do this is manually in general networks are mainly configured with dynamic ip addresses given out by a dynamic host configuration protocol dhcp server however if you need constant access to a device or server in the network it would be beneficial for a specific ip address to stay the same in this edition of cisco tech talk i'll go over some best practices for setting up static ip addresses [Music] i'll start with a little more detail about ip addresses cisco business hardware uses private ip addresses for the local area network lan by default out of the box some equipment comes with a default ip address that you can use to access the web user interface rv series routers come with an ip of 192.168.1.1 cisco business switches 192.168.1.254 and cisco business wireless access points 192.168.1 once those devices are deployed in a dhcp network they will be assigned ip addresses usually chosen from the 192.168.1-0-24-ip pool of addresses these are dynamic and can change over time within the dhcp pool addresses you do have other options for private ip pools including a 10.0.0.088 network or a 172.16.0.0.12 network when you configure the ip address statically no matter what pool of addresses you configure for your network make sure to document the topology and relevant details be sure to note all devices and static ip addresses you configure along with the media access control mac address of each device this is the unique identification number of each piece of hardware when adding static ip addresses there are some important things to keep in mind make sure each ip address is unique in a network if two ip addresses are the same those devices won't be able to communicate on the network duplications can happen in two ways the first is if you assign the same static ip address to two devices it seems unlikely but it does happen this can be prevented if you keep those detailed notes on the topology of your network that was mentioned earlier the second way for duplications to happen is if you set a static ip address on one device and then dhcp assigns the same ip address to another device on the same network this can be prevented by setting up one pool of addresses for dhcp to assign at random and then a separate pool of addresses that is set aside for static ip addressing that way they won't overlap for example create a pool from 192.168.1.50 to 192.168.1.99 for static ip addressing and 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.149 for dhcp [Music] when you assign a static ip address there are certain addresses to avoid for preventing conflicts first don't use an ip address that ends in dot 255 since this is reserved for a broadcast address in this example that would be 192.168.1.255. second don't use an ip address that ends in dot zero because those are normally reserved for networks third don't use an address ending with dot one or dot 254 since these are common default device ip addresses not only that but since the first and last available ip address are so common hackers often try them first when trying to access your network last but not least you should avoid using this same or even an overlapping lan ip subnet while configuring a vpn between different sites this would be a situation when you would want to change one of the lan networks to one of the other options for private ippools a 10.0.0.8 network or a 172.16.0.0.12 network all right now that you know some best practices for static ip addressing i'll log into some equipment to show you how to assign a static ip address on a cisco business device for this first example i'll use a cisco rv 340 router the first thing to do when you log into the rv340 web user interface is to open the lan option and then choose vlan settings there's already an ip address assigned to vlan 1. this screen provides options to add or edit a static ip address to do this select the add icon or the edit icon to edit an existing vlan in this case you can edit the ip address shown here so first you need to select the check box on the same line as the ip address and then click the edit icon here notice that when you click the edit icon all of the available fields that can be changed are shown here you can edit the ip address under ipv4 or even select the subnet mask and choose a dhcp type in this example i'll enter 192.168.1.2 the dhcp pool will be populated automatically once you enable the dhcp server you can change these if needed next be sure to click on the apply button to save the changes the static ip address on the vlan interface is set this process is similar for a cisco business access point i'll walk you through that process next first log into the access point user interface using your credentials navigate to wireless settings and select access points click on the edit icon click yes to continue as you can see the ipconfiguration type is set to obtain from dhcp from the drop down menu select static ip in this example i added a static ip address of 192.168.1.3 enter your preferred static ip address subnet mask and default gateway address which is the router that connects to the internet click apply to save the changes to assign a static ip address on a cisco business switch log in navigate to the ipv4 configuration settings and select the ipv4 interface option click the plus icon to add an ip interface select a vlan from the drop down menu and then choose the ip address type as a static ip after that all you need to do is enter the ip address and the network mask in this example i added an ip address of 192.168.1.4 and a network mask of 255.255.255.0 the settings are finalized click the apply button to save your changes keep these best practices in mind when setting static ip addresses because no matter what changes come your way it's good to know how to keep some things the same well at least in your network thanks for watching i'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "have you ever gone to visit a friend and want to use their wi-fi when you search for available wi-fi networks in your current location you'll see a list of service set identifiers ssids to choose from often when people have wi-fi set up they just leave the ssid to whatever the internet service provider has as its default for that connection typically these ssids are generic listing the provider and then a combination of letters and numbers as shown here there's nothing wrong with keeping the ssid at the default name it works just fine but what if you owned a business like a car repair shop you'd want customers to enjoy their time while they wait you'd offer coffee snacks and wi-fi anything to make their time go by faster a personalized ssid can make it easy for the customer to find your network and get logged in in this episode of cisco tech talk i'll demonstrate how to configure a wireless local area network wlan service set identifier ssid on a cisco business wireless access point to get started log in to your cisco business wireless access point by entering the username and password click sign in after accessing the web user interface of your device navigate to the wireless settings and select wlans here you can view the existing wlan configurations to create a new ssid click on the add new wlan rlan button as you can see under the general tab the wlan id field will auto populate in this case it shows wlan number three as the first option since two wlans are already configured in my network you need to make sure to configure type as wlan to allow devices to connect and communicate in wireless mode next type a profile name in the field provided in this example new underscore ssid is entered you'll want to choose something easy for customers to identify this could be the name of your business or something else creative just keep in mind that the profile name must be unique and not exceed 31 characters the profile name also acts as the ssid but you can choose an ssid that is different from the wlan profile name and to keep things simple i'll use the same name for both profile name and ssid fields after that to enable wlan simply slide the toggle button next select a radio policy from the drop down menu the options include all 5 gigahertz and 2.4 gigahertz for this example all is selected so that the ssid will be visible for both the radio 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz the broadcast ssid feature is enabled by default so the ssid can be discovered by wireless clients wanting to join it the next field is local profiling this is disabled by default if you enable this option you can either view the operating system that is running on the client or the username in this case i'll leave it as disabled next navigate to the wlan security tab here if you enable the guest network the wlan will be considered a guest wlan that provides guest user access this may be what you want but for this example it is left as disabled the captive network assistant feature detects the presence of a captive portal by sending a web request for connecting to a wireless network typically this request is directed to a url for iphone models if a response is received then the internet access is considered available and no further interaction is required if no response is received internet access is assumed to be blocked by the captive portal if this is the case apple's captive portal network assistant auto launches the sudo browser to request a portal login in a controlled window i'm going to leave captive network assistant disabled okay that's the basics so if that's all you need save the configurations and you're set time to get back to business if you want to configure more advanced parameters keep watching i'll start with mac filtering you can restrict or permit a particular client joining your network by enabling the mac filtering feature when mac filtering is enabled on the wlan the client mac address must be added to the local mac address list in this case this feature is disabled under security type select wpa2 wpa3 personnel here wpa2 is enabled by default you can also enable wpa3 individually if the client is wpa3 compatible i'll enable wpa3 next to configure passphrase format i'll choose an ascii value the wpa pre-shared key must contain 8 to 63 ascii text characters or 64 hexadecimal characters after entering the passphrase go ahead and enter it again in the confirm passphrase field you can click on the show passphrase checkbox to see the passphrase you have configured the password expiry feature is disabled by default to enable simply slide the toggle button the maximum range for expiry is 180 days in this scenario it's not enabled from here navigate to the vlan and firewall tab select client ip management as the external dhcp server that will allow the external dhcp server in your network to provide ip addresses to the client [Music] on the next line the peer-to-peer block option is disabled by default if you enable this it'll disable communication between clients that are connected in the same wlan in this case i'm going to go with the default settings after that for the use vlan tagging and enable firewall fields i'll select no the default setting however if you want to tag a vlan in your network for the specific wlan you can enable the vlan tagging option and specify the vlan id from the drop-down menu if you enable the firewall you'll need to configure additional parameters including vlan acl and wlan post auth acl these will be applicable for all wlans under the same vlan next navigate to the traffic shaping tab and select silver best effort option for quality of service qos finally navigate to the scheduling tab here you can choose the schedule for the wlan profile that you're creating you have the option to enable the schedule and apply to all weekdays after that you can specify the time the new ssid will be active for this example 8 o'clock am to 8 o'clock pm is selected once you finalize your settings you can click the apply button the configurations will take effect and the new ssid or new wlan will be created now you know how to add a new wlan and configure an ssid on your cisco business wireless access point customers love when things are easy and simple and when you create a positive experience they'll be back thanks for watching i'll see you next time [Music] you",

default skip adding a description leave ie proxy settings disabled and enable split tunnel [Music] before moving on a little more detail on the split tunnel some people configure it to keep the client's internet traffic at higher speeds with split tunnel you can define which networks you want to access over the vpn essentially you can grant access through the vpn to certain networks and deny access to other networks on the router split tunnel will also only send the client's traffic through the vpn if it's destined for the defined networks all other traffic will be sent out of the client's default gateway since i want to grant access to my router's network i will enter that network under ip address and then the network mask if there are more networks that you wanted to grant the client access to another ip address would be added since there isn't any in my case i just need to click apply ok now that part is set next a user group needs to be created this group will house the user accounts that will have access to the vpn here click add give the group a name and scroll down to ssl vpn under select a profile select the ssl vpn default policy then click apply now you can see the new group has the ssl vpn policy enabled and the admin group has access to the ssl vpn disable access to the ssl vpn for the admin group that group won't have access to the vpn scroll down to ssl vpn and under select a profile choose no policy all right now the only group that has access to the vpn is the anyconnect group next move over to user accounts here is where the user accounts and passwords that connect to the vpn will be created to do this click add enter a username the password and choose the group that was just configured new usernames and passwords will need to be created for all users that will access the vpn click on apply and then click the save icon to save the running configuration to the startup configuration great anyconnect is now configured on your rv340 series router moving right along it's time for the second section of the configurations setting up the mac vpn client if you do not have a license yet please call a cisco authorized partner to purchase one if you do not have a cisco partner see the link in the description once you have the anyconnect license purchased you can download the cisco anyconnect client from cisco agree to the software license agreement and confirm the install [Music] you may get a message like what is shown here saying the extension was blocked if so you will need to edit your system preferences click allow once and then again for the installation to be complete okay to get everything connected open the anyconnect client and enter the router's public address followed by the port number you chose in the rv 340 series router configuration i left the port at the default of 8443 you can check the port number you configured in the rv 340 series under ssl vpn and gateway port click connect you may see an untrusted server message because anyconnect doesn't recognize the rv340 series public ip address don't worry the settings can be changed i know that this ip address is my router's public ip address so there's no security issue therefore i will change my setting and uncheck the block connections option and click connect again another message may appear like in this instance but since this public ip address is set to my rv 340 series router i know it is a trusted server and i can click connect anyway the username and password you created on the router needs to be entered once clicking on accept the vpn is connected mission accomplished now that the configurations are complete if you want to see how many users are connected to the vpn navigate to system summary click status and statistics and scroll down under vpn status to ssl vpn here it will show how many connected sessions are running one giant leap for mankind oh yeah now your mac users can use anyconnect vpn to access the network in a simple secure way no rocket scientist required thanks for watching i'll see you next time [Music] you",

    "transcript": "have you ever seen a puppy chase's tail spinning in never-ending circles you just know that silly dog is exhausting all his time and energy without any progress to show in a network messages can get stuck in a loop too by default switches forward broadcast messages out every port besides the port that sent the message this is helpful to get the message to the right place but it can also cause problems if they are continuously circling around the network if a message keeps looping around router resources are flooded in what is called a broadcast storm luckily there's a simple way to prevent these loops you set up spanning tree protocol in this episode of cisco tech talk i'll show you how to configure spanning tree protocol stp on a cisco business 350 switch through the command line interface to get started log into the switch console via the putty application and enter the username and password the default for both is cisco in all lowercase letters this gets you inside the privilege exec mode once inside type configure terminal to get into the global configuration mode of the switch now to enable stp enter spanning tree followed by the command mode to select which stp protocol to run as you can see there are five different mode options available stp rstp which is the default mode mst pvst and rapid pvst for this example i'll use stp next the spanning tree bridge forward time this is the amount of time a port remains in the listening and learning states before entering the forwarding state the range is 4 to 30 seconds and the default value is 15 seconds for this example i'm going to enter spanning tree forward times 16. when configuring the forward time the following relationship should be maintained two into forward time minus one should be greater than or equal to max age moving along the spanning tree max age command can be used to configure stp maximum age this determines how often broadcast hello messages are sent out the range is 6 to 40 and the default maximum age is 20 seconds here 16 specifies the spanning tree bridge maximum age in seconds when configuring the maximum age keep in mind two into forward time minus one should be greater than or equal to max age the max age is greater than or equal to two into hello time plus one now the roof bridge can be configured the range is zero to sixty one thousand four hundred forty and the default bridge priority is thirty two thousand seven hundred sixty eight in this example i'll type spanning tree priority 12 288 where 12 288 specifies the bridge priority the priority value must be a multiple of 4096. the switch with the lowest priority is the route of the spanning tree when more than one switch has the lowest priority the switch with the lowest mac address is selected as the route set the default path cost method just type the spanning tree pathcost method command [Music] looking at the options there are two cost methods long and short for this example i'm going to select long which is also the default setting okay that completed successfully so you should be set on the basics from here you have some options for additional stp commands these commands would be set and executed on specific ports by default spanning tree is enabled on all ports so to disable spanning tree on a specific port enter interface fi101 where one slash zero slash one indicates the specific port number followed by the command spanning tree disabled that's it the interface is disabled to move on simply type exit to move to another interface [Music] to configure the spanning tree path cost for a port log into the interface the range is 1 to two hundred million for this example i'll type spanning tree cost thirty five thousand thirty five thousand specifies the port path cost it's important to note that the default path cost is determined by the port speed and path cost method in this interface you need to configure port priority the range is 0 to 240 and the default port priority is 128. for this one use 96 by entering spanning tree port priority 96 sometimes you may want to enable port fast mode for an interface so that it is put into a forwarding state upon linkup without waiting for the standard forward time delay to do this enter interface fi104 then type the spanning tree portfast command alternatively you can use the spanning tree portfast auto command to delay the portfast mode for three seconds typing spanning tree bpdu defines bridge protocol data unit or bpdu handling when the spanning tree is disabled globally or on a single interface as you can see there are two modes flooding and filtering on this interface i'll use flooding which is the default setting the filtering and flooding modes are relevant when the spanning tree is disabled globally or on a single interface to define bpdu handling when the spanning tree is disabled on a single interface go ahead and enter the interface followed by spanning tree bpdu flooding if you want to shut down all interfaces if a loopback bpdu is received on them simply type spanning tree loopback guard bravo now you have a pack of commands you can use to configure stp on your cbs switch using the cli it can make all the difference in an efficient network because unlike an energetic puppy you don't want your network to tire out thanks for watching i'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "imagine you purchased a car change the oil and put in a full tank of gas you should be at all systems go but when you finally turn the key it won't start you can do all the right things and still have problems if you've installed any connect on your rv340 series router and are having connectivity problems don't spin out i'm here to help you get the pedal to the metal and get you connected in this episode of cisco tech talk i'll show you some troubleshooting steps for anyconnect vpn connectivity on rv340 series routers [Music] just like you would tune up a car to keep it up to date you should make sure that your rv340 series router has the latest firmware running you can verify this after signing into the router web user interface navigate to status and statistics and then system summary this screen shows you the firmware version that is active on the router to find out if it's the latest firmware version available for your device go to cisco.com click support and enter your rv340 series router model number and then downloads to check if you need to update the firmware on your device there are several articles and videos on the cisco website as well perform the upgrade save the updated configuration and reboot if your firmware is already the latest version make sure any running configurations are saved and then perform a reboot of the router a reboot can be a simple way to get things back on track to reboot the router navigate to administration and then reboot at this point you will select reboot the device option and then click reboot at the top of the screen when the router has finished rebooting try to connect to the vpn again if you're still unable to connect the next step is to make sure the rv340 series router has internet connectivity without connectivity your communication gets sent out but hits a dead end to check this go to administration and then diagnostic for this example i'll enter a known google server to ping on the internet by typing 8.8.8.8 in the ip address domain name field and then click ping as you can see the ping was successful which means the rv340 series router has internet access if your ping fails make sure your internet is properly connected to the wan port if it continues to fail then it could be due to an improper internet connection in a situation where your router is connected to a modem or another router try to reboot that device if an internet ping still fails this can be an internet service provider issue and you may need to speak to them to get it sorted out moving along the next troubleshooting step is to look at the router's logs basically looking under the hood of your network to generate logs you need to make sure that logging is enabled click on system configuration and then select log in the navigation pane click the box to enable select a debugging option for severity and then click apply it's important that this debugging option is only selected during troubleshooting as it consumes memory quickly at this point navigate to status and statistics and choose view logs in the menu click the all check box to unselect them then enable only the ssl vpn option and click on show logs make sure to click the clear logs button so that you will only see the fresh new logs [Music] have the client attempt to connect to the vpn if the client fails to connect click on show logs as you can see logs are being generated so this means that the vpn packets are getting to the router if there are no logs this means that no vpn packets are coming into the router now let's look at a scenario where logs are being generated when the client tries to connect in this example you can see some logs usually these logs will have relevant information as to why the vpn connection is failing in this log you can see that the password is not correct when you see this message make sure to check your accounts and verify that you are using the correct passwords to do this go ahead and click on system configuration and then user accounts on this screen you can see the accounts that are available for this example i created the user1 account for anyconnectvpn use now i'll click edit to look at it in your case if you want to enter a new password simply enter the old password and fill out the new password fields if you've forgotten the password then the best option is to create a new user with a new password it's like getting a new key made for your car to create a new user go to local users and click the plus sign to add then enter your username and password make sure to add the correct group that is being used to authenticate to the ssl vpn for this example the group is anyconnect but keep in mind that your group may be different go ahead and click apply to save your changes another troubleshooting method is to make sure that the vpn authentication is configured correctly to check this scroll down to service auth sequence as you can see the anyconnect ssl vpn auth sequence is set to default if you are authenticating vpn users using a radius server then this configuration is fine if your vpn users are being authenticated locally from the rv340 series router then you'll need to set the primary to localdb or local database it's also important to choose a secondary auth and you can set this to be any one of the options except none click apply to save the configuration and then confirm the changes were saved if the router didn't save the configuration perform these last steps again and click apply [Music] to check this when the user attempts to connect to the vpn again click on show logs to confirm that the vpn tunnel has been established correctly now consider a scenario where you are not getting any vpn logs what do you do then first look at the ssl vpn configuration on the router just like construction can shut down roads closed ports can stop connections to check this navigate to vpn and then open ssl vpn and check the gateway port this port needs to be open to connect the vpn most of the time if the router is directly connected to the internet service provider the router will automatically open this port and you won't need to change anything but sometimes the router connects to the internet through an isp modem or a different router if this is the case you'll need to make sure the router or modem in front of the rv 340 series router is port forwarding the gateway port to the rv 340 router i feel confident that these troubleshooting steps will get you out of the starting gate and into the fast lane however if your vpn is still not connecting contact a cisco representative for more advanced troubleshooting please see the link attached to the description for more information thanks for watching i'll see you next time [Music] you",

    "transcript": "if you're just starting out with a cisco business network it can be overwhelming there's a lot to learn one of the first and most common actions you need to perform as a network administrator is accessing the hardware accessing the web user interface is the easiest way to do configurations updates and troubleshooting it certainly comes in handy luckily every cisco business switch besides the 100 series comes with a web ui this type of interface what you see on your screen shows options for selection you do not need to know any special commands to navigate through these screens in this episode of cisco tech talk i'll show you how to access the web ui of your cisco business switch there are two different ways to access the web ui the first scenario is if the switch is not directly connected to your network and isn't receiving an ip address via your dhcp server the second scenario is when your switch is connected to your network and your network is providing a dhcp address for it i'll start with the switch not directly connected to the network to start we need to log into the switch with its ip address so we will need to determine what that ip address is i'm going to connect to the switch when it is not connected to the network getting a dhcp address to do this i'll connect the switch to my pc with an ethernet cable by default the switch will have an ip address of 192.168.1.254 [Music] in this situation on the front of the switch the system light will be flashing green that means it is up and operational but it is not receiving an ip address via dynamic host configuration protocol dhcp if the switch has an ip address assigned to it either via dhcp server or statically on the switch the system led will be solid green click the windows icon at the bottom left-hand corner of the screen select the gear icon for settings go into the networking internet options on the windows pc you can also access this with a right click on the internet status icon on the bottom right of your screen and select open network and internet settings change adapter options to go to the ethernet connection it shows an unidentified network right-click and select properties go into ipv4 double-click it or select and click properties statically assign an ip address to the computer in the same subnet as the switch in this case i'll enter 192.168.1.10 and hit tab the correct subnet mask automatically fills in with a slash 24 which is 255.255.255.0 [Music] we don't need a default gateway but if you want you can enter it it would be the ip address of the switch i'll skip that since it's all in the same subnet it isn't necessary click ok and then close nothing will change here on the status but if you want to verify your ip address on the computer open a command prompt here and enter ipconfig space all here under ethernet adapter the ip address is assigned as well as the subnet mask in the browser type in the ip address of the switch again it goes straight to the login screen the default username and password for both is cisco all lowercase once logged in you need to change the username and password assuming the password matches everything will go smoothly here and it should log you out of this switch when you hit apply and give it a couple of seconds from now on log in with the new credentials now that you are logged in you will notice a flashing red save icon which indicates that there has been a change to the configuration in this case it was the username and password from here you can manage the switch as needed now i'll show you how to manage the switch when it is connected directly to a network that is supplying a dhcp address to the switch first find out and verify that you have an ip address assigned to the computer in the same network as the switch in the windows search bar type cmd and select to open the command prompt enter ipconfig space forward slash all in this example my ethernet has the following ip address ending in dot 124 another way to find the ip address is to run an ip scanner there are many options for ip scanners that can be found and downloaded with a simple google search cisco does not support or recommend any specific software for this process the one i chose is called advanced ip scanner here you can see the ip address that is connected to a specific mac address a mac address is the unique number associated with a specific piece of equipment the mac address can also be found on the back or the bottom of the switch mine is the one ending in 2 5 colon 2 8 and it's receiving the ip address ending in 1 2 9. i'm going to put this ip address into a web browser in this example i'll use firefox once the ip address of the switch is entered the login screen is shown from here log in with your credentials to get into the web ui of the switch as you can see you're now logged into your device's web ui login page and have the power to control the switch as needed after following these steps for connectivity with your cbs switch you should be on your way thanks for watching i'll see you next time [Music] you",

    "transcript": "every day you make dozens of decisions some are easy like what to have for dinner or if you want a brownie cake or pie for dessert deciding on what to get for a wireless mesh network not so easy that's why i'm here today i'd like to help you figure out what you need using cisco business wireless cbw 140 145 and 240 access points these aps are 802.11 a slash b g n and ac based with internal antennas they support 802.11 ac wave 2 standard for high performance in a cbw mesh network you must have one wired primary ap for the bridge to the rest of the wireless network the primary ap directly links to the primary router which in turn routes traffic to the wan isp interface the internet once your wired primary ap has been selected you have several options for the rest of the wireless network which ap combination is the best for you in this episode of cisco tech talk i'll review the features and options that will help you with this fun but important decision like eating dessert first let's start with the best part the 140 145 and 240 ac models work together which gives you the flexibility to add or move these aps around if your needs change any of these models can be a wired primary ap a backup wired ap or even run as a wireless mesh extender you can pick any of these models or any combination as long as the primary ap is wired sweet right okay let's dig in a little more at a high level the 140 and 145 ac models have the same processor and the same memory the 240 ac is a higher performing model it has more radios a faster processor and more random access memory or ram moving on from the basics i'll go over some important considerations where do you want to mount the access points the 140 and 240 models are meant to be attached to the ceiling while the 145 is built for a wall mount next you'll have to figure out how many access points you'll need the 140 and 145 ac models cover a maximum distance between aps of 50 to 60 feet the 240 ac covers a maximum distance between aps of 60 to 70 feet this estimated range assumes the aps are in an open area if the area is not open you should reduce those values by 20 to 30 percent as a general guideline coverage should overlap at least 10 to 20 percent as with all wireless aps there will be some variance depending on the configuration and environment thinking about your network devices will you need extra ethernet ports or power over ethernet ports the 140 ac does not have extra ethernet ports or downstream power over ethernet capabilities the 145 ac has three ethernet ports where you can connect additional devices such as an ip phone or security camera one of these ports can provide power over ethernet poe but only if the 145 ac itself is connected to an 802.380 port on the uplink if the 145 ac is only connected to an 802.3af uplink port it will have enough power to run but not enough to provide poe if you don't need poe and just need some additional ports for ethernet this is a great option if poe is essential you may want to choose the 240 ac this model has one extra ethernet port that provides downstream power over ethernet the next option to consider is do you need a pass-through port the 145 ac is the only one in this series with a pass-through port which is essentially a cable extension it gives network access to another device without having to use a switch it's like having another wall jack finally you need to decide if you want a backup wired primary ap if you're a believer in better safe than sorry you can set up two wired aps in the network this would give you a primary ap and an automatic backup in case the primary ap goes down setup and management can be done through the cisco business mobile application which keeps things simple what's great is that you can always add additional aps from this series later adding aps to an existing cbw mesh network is simple the firmware on the new ap will be updated automatically if needed and then join the network in addition to these primary capable aps you can use cbw 141 and 143 acm models of mesh extenders for all or part of the wireless portion of these networks and now that you know the options and features of these cbw aps it should make this decision as easy as pie or at least enough to get started thanks for watching i'll see you next time [Music] you",

    "transcript": "most networks use Dynamic host configuration protocol DHCP to assign IP addresses in a network these addresses are given out from a pool of IP addresses they're not permanent and can change over time in some cases you may want to change a dynamic IP to a static IP address so that it doesn't change this is considered a best practice on switches that handle a lot of network traffic if you need to set access rules firewall rules or make future changes on the switch you will want a static IP on the switch interface in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll show you how to convert a Cisco business switch CBS 220 250 or 350 Dynamic IP address to a static IP address on the vlan1 interface to begin there are a few settings that need to be configured on the web user interface log to the switch by entering your username and password although the default for both is Cisco in all lowercase it is best practice to change the default login credentials enter yours here next navigate to status and statistics and then system summary here you can see the MAC address and firmware of the switch a MAC address is the unique number associated with a specific piece of equipment the MAC address can also be found on the back or the bottom of the switch knowing the MAC address will help you find out the DHCP IP address that is connected to that switch move over to the ipv4 configuration tab and select ipv4 interface in this example the IP address type on the VLAN 1 interface is DHCP and the current IP address ends in 1.1 129 the beginning two octets will be blurred in this video this is to maintain privacy for this Network on this switch example the VLAN 1 interface is the only one configured to change the IP address check the box in front of VLAN 1 and then select the edit icon under IP address type select the static IP address radio button this has made the IP address static instead of dynamic if that's all you need you're set but if you want to change the static IP to a specific static IP address there are a few more steps that need to be performed to show this I'll close and not save the changes still on the IP V4 interface click the add icon leave VLAN 1 choose static IP address and add an IP address in this case I'll enter an IP ending in 7613 enter a prefix length of 24 which is the same as a network mask of 2552 [Music] [Music] [Music] 255.255.0.0 an IP ending in 7613 once you have entered your IP address you will be brought back to the login screen log in using your credentials and then hit the login button now to confirm these settings navigate to ipv4 configuration and choose ipv4 interface the vlan1 interface address type is currently set to static and the IP address ends with 7613 if you're set click on the blinking red save icon to save this configuration if you want to change it to another IP address in the same subnet you have a few options you can delete the entry by clicking on the delete icon wait for a new Dynamic IP address to be assigned and then follow the steps we went through earlier another option is to add another IP address to the same VLAN as a static IP it's important to note that if you're trying to add another IP ad address in the same subnet the switch will not allow it the solution is to add an IP address in a totally different subnet once that has been added you need to change your PC so it is in the same subnet that way they can connect and communicate to do this go into your Windows settings under network and internet status settings enter change adapter options click the ethernet port you're using select properties then tcp/ipv4 properties set a static IP in the same subnet that was assigned to VLAN 1 on the switch the subnet mask will be [Music] 255.255.255.0 in this case I don't need to enter a default gateway but if you enter one put in the IP address up the switch click okay and okay again to verify this change in the windows search bar enter command prompt and select type ip config and hit enter the new IP address is listed here enter the new IP address in a web browser type in your credentials and click login under ipv4 configuration and then ipv4 interface you will see the two addresses since only one is being used for management you can delete the other one click to select the old IP address and then the delete icon select the plus icon and then static IP address enter an IP address in that original Subnet in this example I'll enter an IP ending in 7615 and the prefix length of 24 click apply then on your Windows PC go into settings under network and internet status enter change adapter options click the ethernet port you are using select properties then tcp/ipv4 properties change the static IP address back to DHCP click okay this will get your PC a dynamic IP address in the original subnet click okay to verify go into command prompt enter ip config again here you will see the IP address listed use that new IP to log into the switch by entering the IP address in the web browser from here enter your credentials and log into the switch navigate to the ipv4 configuration and then ipv4 interface one more time now you can select and then click the delete icon to delete this IP address now you have one IP address for the switch click the red blinking save icon this can also be done under Administration file management and file operations click duplicate running configuration to Startup configuration and [Music] apply nice work you now know a few ways to change a dynamic IP address on VLAN 1 to a static IP address on a CBS 220 250 or 350 switch thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "when you operate a business out of your home a switch can be like the electricity powering your home essential an unmanaged switch can be a valuable cost-effective solution for making your office network successful let's talk about these options and finding the right unmanaged switch for your needs [Music] so let's walk through the basics say you run a small home office in this case an unmanaged switch is how you might make the devices on your network desktop computers printers wireless access points ip phones etc effectively talk to one another if this scenario matches yours you should consider an unmanaged switch for your network so what other criteria best describes an ideal candidate for an unmanaged switch well for starters they're ideal for small businesses and home offices on a budget as they're traditionally less expensive than other types of switches and they're perfect for situations where an it person or department are not in the picture they're truly plug and play devices when you have an existing functional network setup if you're working with a small team that needs computers printers security cameras or any other ethernet connected devices to talk to one another an unmanaged switch is potentially an ideal answer for you particularly considering the reliable connection to the network when compared against a wireless access point though wireless devices can provide a convenient on-the-go connection they can encounter interference conversely ethernet wired devices tend to be less susceptible to signal degradation due to interference from competing wireless devices in your office the cisco business 110 series of unmanaged switches are a great place to start they're affordable they can operate at high speeds for bandwidth intensive usage they come with a variety of port configurations depending on how many you anticipate needing for your own networking situation and they're either rack or desktop mountable in addition the ppd 16 pp and 24 pp models are outfitted with power over ethernet capabilities in some of their ports which means you can connect and power compatible devices such as ip phones wireless access points and security cameras with just an ethernet cable keep in mind that not all the ports are poe capable for instance in the 8 port model as many as half the ports can support poe depending on the model so what makes one of these 110 series switches different than the other when it comes to deciding on the best option you'll want to identify your ideal port count whether poe is valuable to your situation and which power supply type makes the most sense for the way your network is set up with a range of 5 to 24 port models usage is scalable depending on the size of your operation if you're a team of 10 with multiple devices allocated per person in addition to shared network devices you might err on the side of the larger port number smaller models such as 5p and 8p are designed to sit comfortably on your desktop while larger port models are designed for convenient rack mounting if you're a single person operation a basic 5 port model might be enough to fit your needs what makes the smallest model the 5td different from the largest the 24pp goes simply beyond the number of ports on the switch increased ports also impact the switch's capacity and speed not to mention the fact that a 5 td can be placed simply on your desktop while a 24pp will require a closet or cabinet to mount so the actual question at hand which model of unmanaged switch is right for you well for instance i run an e-commerce business from my home selling a pretty small amount of inventory and i work with two other teammates we've each got a desktop computer and we share a printer for printing postage as well as iphones and we've got access points set up for ourselves and for guest wi-fi when we host a meeting with third-party vendors so for my home office i use the 8 ppd it has enough ports to meet my device needs power over ethernet capabilities for our access points and phones and i left myself some extra ports that can be used down the road should the business grow when i require them but how about you what do you need to stay connected this video should have given you just the tools you need to get to the bottom of that question just be sure to start with the cisco 110 series of unmanaged switches and you're halfway there thanks for watching this edition of cisco business basics happy networking friends [Music]",

    "transcript": "many businesses use a virtual private Network a VPN so employees can access company resources while away from the office pretty typical but sometimes access requirements get a little more complicated like what if your employees need VPN access to two different sites can it be done you bet you just need a client to cite VPN and a site to site VPN this configuration will eliminate the need for setting up the client-to-site VPN configuration on both routers instead there will be two remote networks in my example a home network and an rv340w office network will be used are you ready to take on this challenge let me get you on your way in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll guide you through the configurations needed for a client to connect to two different sites using the rv340w router I'll begin by creating an ipsec profile this profile will be used to configure the encryption for the layer 2 tunneling protocol lttp VPN to create a profile navigate to the ipsec profile table and click the plus icon enter a profile name I'll Select Auto for the keying mode and Ike version 1 for the ike version to select the diffie-hellman DH group click on group 2-1024 bit although there are different encryption levels select triple Des use sha-1 as the authentication method to connect the VPN and set the essay lifetime for Phase 1 to 86 400. for Phase 2 select ESP for the protocol selection and triple Des for the encryption next use sha1 as the authentication method and set the essay lifetime to 28 800. disable perfect forward secrecy these encryption levels were selected because they are compatible with Microsoft's built-in VPN to see a list of recommended settings check out the site keep in mind that Cisco does not support these third-party sites they are shown for your reference if you change any of these settings the VPN will fail to connect and nobody wants that to keep moving along you will need to create a user group that contains the clients that will establish a client-to-site VPN connection after creating a group create user accounts for each member add the newly created group to this account the number of accounts is based on the number of users a unique username and password are required for each user to use the VPN additionally ensure that the service auth sequence for lttp is configured notice that the primary authentication method for lttp is automatically set to radius in the server off sequence change that to the local database for the secondary choose radius here the router will not accept the none option the local database should be set as the primary which is where the VPN client authentications will be sent to now verify the changes were applied to the service auth sequence for the lttp server once confirmed you can move on to the configuration of the ltp VPN to enable the lttp server select the on checkbox the IP address is essential this IP pool range must be distinct from the client and router Networks this will be added to the IP group later as it is the network for the VPN add a DNS server Lan IP address of the router and then a second DNS server address of 8.8.8.8 this is a well-known Google server make sure to add the ltp group you previously created to activate the ipsec profile select the profile that was just created and input a secure pre-shared key click apply to save your changes to create the client's site use the built-in VPN in Windows start by selecting add and provide a name for the connection the server's name or address will be your remote router's public IP address assigned on the WAN interface Additionally you can specify an fqdn if you have one select ltp with a pre-shared key as the VPN type afterward enter the pre-shared key configured earlier click save select the newly created adapter click on properties then security make sure that these Protocols are allowed if you choose Microsoft Chat version 2 the VPN will not be able to connect so choose Pap click on it and then click ok great the basic setup on that end is complete moving on you need to create the site-to-site VPN between the home network and the rv340w network therefore you need to create local groups and give them a name it's important to know your local network as well as the network of your lttp as both these networks will be added to the IP group choose an IP address subnet so that all addresses in that subnet are accessible via the site to site VPN to begin enter the address of the home router in this example 192.168.1.0 24. this enables the VPN to connect to all IP addresses in the 192.168.1.0 network you can also specify an IP address if you want to allow only one IP address to connect to the VPN or even an IP address range in this example the type is subnet the device type and the operating system type will be any next add the subnet of the VPN in this case 10.25.25.0 24. this is the subnet for the lttp VPN that was just created these options allow all IP addresses in that subnet to connect to the VPN to save the ipgroup settings click apply great that part is set moving on it's time to configure the site to site VPN to begin go to the site to site VPN menu and select add check the box next to add edit a new connection enter the connection name and choose the default ipsec profile if there is already a custom profile select it what matters here is that both ends of the VPN the home network and the rv340w network use the same ipsec profile then choose the interface with an internet connection that would be Wan 1 in this case the remote endpoint will be assigned a static IP address thereafter enter the pre-shared key although it isn't recommended you can disable the minimum pre-shared key complexity if you choose select a specific IP address as the local identifier type to keep this simple and secure choose local fqdn the local identifier can be anything but it must contain a DOT I'll keep my local identifier as router.vpn for Simplicity then as the local IP type select the IP group defined earlier this determines which local networks can connect to the VPN in this instance 192.168.1.0 is the network address of my local router Additionally the ltp VPN network 10.25.25.0 is included in this IP group next choose fqdn again for the remote identifier an arbitrary name for Simplicity in this example I'll use remote.vpn as the remote identifier the remote IP type can be a single IP address a subnet or a set of IP addresses this defines who will be permitted to connect to the VPN from a remote location [Music] if I choose an IP address I will only be able to Define one if I choose IP group all devices in that IP group will be allowed regardless of their IP address after that select a subnet this will allow you to connect to a VPN enabled subnet enter the rv340w Network's subnet and type in the subnet mask then under advanced settings enable both the keep alive and dead peer detection options both of these options will Aid in the maintenance of the VPN connection if one side loses connectivity the VPN should automatically attempt to re-establish the connection not let the home network router has been configured you can configure the rb340w network first create an IP address group and designate it as a remote group this group will contain the remote networks that will be allowed through the VPN including my home network following that enter the 192.168.1.0 address and the 10.25.25.0 for the lttp VPN IP subnet next proceed to the VPN configuration here you will want to ensure that the VPN is activated Additionally the ipsec profiles must match on both sides leave this as the default the interface should be where your internet connection is the remote endpoint should be the other end's static IP address or fqdn next use the static IP address assigned to the home network then enter the pre-shared key this should be the same as what you specified in the other end for the router site-to-site configuration use the same options for the local group identifier as you did for the first site to site VPN so choose local fqdn and name this remote.vpn notice here that remote.vpn was the remote identifier for the site to site VPN configured on the home network router it has now been designated as the local identifier and as a result it is reversed connect to the same subnet that the rv340w network is on in this case the router's local group configuration should match the home Network router's remote group they are once again reversed configure the remote group setup next this should correspond to the local group configured in the home network router select remote fqdn as the remote identifier type and enter the remote identifier router.vpn followed by the IP group this is the IP group that I've just created after this navigate to advanced settings and ensure that both keep alive and dpd are selected as a result I can now see my site to site VPN is connected after that try to Ping from the client's site ping the home network first take note that the Ping was successful here ping the rb340w network to continue ping is a success from the client site you can connect to both routers as a result the client now has access to both routers the rb340w network router and the home network router this is accomplished by connecting the client to the home network router via an lttp VPN additionally a site-to-site VPN connection was established between the home network router and the rv340w network router add the network of your lttp VPN as well as the local network to the IP group this granted site-to-site VPN access to the lttatp VPN client the Alta TP VPN client now has a connection to both the home network and the rv340w network all set your clients can access both network resources while they work remotely thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "have you ever had your computer crash and you lost all the files you needed for a big project I have and let me tell you it's a nightmare but from that experience I learned to store copies on an external hard drive or another safe location now that I have planned ahead I can rest easy in that same way networks can be unpredictable so a backup for the configuration of your Cisco business wireless cbw access point can really save the day planning for it just in case doesn't take long gives you security and can be a big Time Saver down the road in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll show you how to back up and restore the configuration of your cbw access points start by logging into your access point by entering the username and password click sign in navigate to Advanced and then click on the primary AP tools option once you're on the primary AP tools page go to the configuration management tab here under the config update section you have the option to upload and download your configuration of the cbw AP at any point you can export the current primary AP configuration to a text format when saving a backup configuration it's important to back up the most recent working configuration of the access point to do that simply choose the direction as download from the drop down menu and select HTTP as the transfer mode then when you click apply a pop-up window will appear click yes to confirm that you want to download the configuration file by default the file is saved as a config text file in the downloads folder of your PC it's as simple as that alternatively if you want to import a configuration from a previously saved configuration file select upload for the direction field under transfer mode the options include HTTP SFTP FTP and tftp if you select SFTP FTP or tftp then you must enter the mandatory parameters like file path file name and IP address as you can see you also have the option to perform Imports on a regular basis to set this you enable the schedule update toggle and then configure the frequency the frequency options are once hourly weekly or monthly after you specify the date and time just click apply by default the schedule update option is disabled on the cbwap [Music] for this example I'll use the HTTP option to transfer the file once you click apply a pop-up window will appear click browse to locate the configuration file from the downloads folder after selecting the file simply click open and then click yes as you can see the import process will start be patient it takes a few minutes to upgrade the configuration as a reminder the import will cause all the primary capable access points in the network to reboot when the access points come back online the primary AP election process takes place the primary AP comes back online with the newly imported configuration once the reboot process completes go ahead and log into your access point Again by entering the username and password click sign in did you know that it is also possible to download and upload the configuration file of an individual access point or mesh extender to do that navigate to monitoring and under Network summary click on access points here you can view the table listing the primary capable AP primary AP and mesh extenders in your network select any device from the list and scroll down the page for this example I've selected the mesh extender under the tools tab you can see the export config and import config options to download the running configuration of the mesh extender simply click the export config button the configuration will get downloaded as a text file simple and easy by default the configuration file is saved to the downloads folder of your PC the name will show as the ap's MAC address underscore config text file if you want to be extra safe you can save it to an external hard drive as well these export and import options are available for the primary AP as well as all the aps associated with the primary AP the mandatory configurations of an AP are exported this includes information on General details radio details mesh extenders mode details ethernet bridging and vlans you can use this file to restore the access point even after a factory reset using the import config option you can upload the configuration file in a text format to do this you need to click the browse button to locate the configuration file select the file click open and then click yes once the configuration has been applied successfully you will see a notification in the web UI of your AP it's important to note that non-mesh AP configuration files should not be imported to mesh deployment APS also after uploading the configuration to the AP it normally takes one to two minutes to take effect you may notice that the LED of the AP will change from solid or blinking green to blinking Amber while the configuration is being applied it goes back to blinking green once the upload is complete that's it you know all you need to know to make sure your cbw AP configuration is backed up and will be there for a restore if needed now it's up to you to stay on top of it thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "one of my favorite games as a kid was telephone to play you'd sit in a circle with friends one player starts by Whispering something to the person on their left that person must repeat the same sentence quietly and only once to the person on their left this continues the same way until the message has been passed all the way around the circle the last person gets to announce to the group what they heard then the first person tells everyone the original statement it can be pretty funny most often the words meaning and intention are totally different than how it started a perfect example of how miscommunication can happen entertaining is a game but not something you want in real life especially when you're conducting business the term choppy audio is used when you're on an MPP phone and the person on the other end of the conversation can't hear you because the sound Cuts in and out if you're having issues with choppy audio you need to get to the root of the problem start with some basics is it happening on all the phones or just one is it intermittent or constant in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll show you how to troubleshoot choppy audio on Cisco multi-platform MPP phones next foreign things first if you're experiencing choppy audio try to isolate the problem for example if it's just happening on one phone check to see if it's the cord you can simply swap out the cord to test that you could also have the sound go through the speakers on the phone to see what happens when the wireless microphone is used if choppy audio is an issue on all the phones most often it's an internal Network issue to test this ping a server like Google DNS in terminal Ping 8.8.8.8 On the same network as the phone to see if you get replies next gather information for your internet service provider a packet test will most likely show whether it's a Jitter packet loss or latency let me let me explain some details about each of these Jitter is the variation in packet latency when you make a phone call your voice is transformed into digital bits and enclosed for transmission at the receiving end the packets are de-encapsulated and transformed to an analog frequency these packets should come at equally spaced intervals however Network difficulties can cause irregular arrivals packet loss occurs when one or more transmitted data packets fail to arrive at their destination latency is the time it takes for data to pass from one point on a network to another so if the response time is poor a one-way delay of 150 milliseconds or less Jitter of 30 milliseconds or less or when a packet is lost you'll notice phone problems since these are internet enabled devices if your internet connection is experiencing trouble the audio will be choppy if the issue is not Jitter packet loss or latency it could be the audio it's possible that the receiver is having a hard time hearing you this could be related to the upload or download speed in many cases networks have significantly higher download speeds than upload speeds this can be confirmed by running a speed test there are many free options available for this in this example I'll use speedtest.net if your download speed is adequate then you should be able to hear them fine if you are hearing them clearly but they are not hearing you it could be due to the upload speed it's possible that you do not have enough bandwidth for all the devices in your network as shown in this example there are 10 computers and phones on the network requiring more bandwidth for the uploads needed if this could be your issue contact your internet service provider or network administrator and let them know that you're experiencing losses you may need an upgrade for a better upload speed perhaps this is not the case your internet speed is fine however you're still having problems since it's not a hardware issue it is most likely an issue with the voice provider contact them next there you have it some good options to get your audio fixed and get you back to business thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "remember that sound that's what connecting to the internet used to sound like it's safe to say that technology has made leaps inbounds since then I mean think about it when was the last time you even used a wired connection to access the internet can't even remember and with the introduction of 802.11ax also known as Wi-Fi six Wireless has been taken to a whole new level The Cisco Business Wireless 150 ax access points and 151axm mesh extenders use this incredible new technology in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll introduce you to the new Cisco business 150 ax access points and 151 axm mesh extenders next foreign things first you should know that the cbw 150ax and 151 axm are not compatible with the previous cbw series that includes the 140 145 and 240 acaps coexistence on the same Lan as the previous series is not supported so to create a Wi-Fi 6 cbw mesh Network you should have at least one 150ax primary AP and one 151 axm mesh extender to start I'll dig into some of the important authentication and security Technologies on these APS the features include Wi-Fi protected access with WPA2 including WPA2 Enterprise and wpa3 Authentication 802.11r for fast roaming and low latency especially with voice over IP 802.11i for strong security 802.1x providing radius authentication authorization and accounting or AAA segmentation with up to 16 vlans and as an added bonus guest Network clients have the option to authenticate with Google or Facebook these security features are just the protection you need for your wireless network next I'll talk numbers you can have a maximum number of 200 Associated Wireless clients per Wi-Fi radio for a total of 400 clients per access point or a thousand in a system you can have up to 50 access points although it's recommended you keep a maximum of 25. for mesh extenders you should have no more than 25 per access point and no more than eight hops okay now I'll run down some of the 802.11 ax capabilities they're impressive I'll start with a 2x2 Uplink downlink mu mimo with two spatial streams this technology allows several devices in your network to communicate with your access point at the same time rather than wait their turn mimo breaks up the internet bandwidth into separate channels for each device the Uplink downlink ofdma feature improves the process of sending and receiving more data across a greater number of channels using different frequencies large channels carry bulky data while the smaller channels carry the light these channels can be used at the same time without latency Target wake time or twt technology sets up scheduled times on Wi-Fi devices to send or receive data when it's not transferring data the device goes into sleep mode to save battery life basic service set or BSS coloring detects and identifies devices and other networks and then marks each network with a different color maximum ratio combining or MRC increases signal quality on the perceiving end of data 802.11 ax beamforming directs signals more efficiently directly to a receiving device instead of sending the signal out in all directions and these are just some of the impressive features on The Cisco Business Wireless 150 ax access points and cbw151axm mesh extenders who knows what technology the future has in store I can only imagine for now I'll enjoy my new and improved wireless network thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "company phones most offices have them Cisco multi-platform or MPP phones provide connectivity with voice and sometimes video you depend on them working the minute you need them whether calling someone in a different department another state or even across the world it's tough to conduct a business without them your customers count on being able to stay in contact but what do you do when an MPP phone doesn't work time to do some troubleshooting you've solved problems in your network before it's time to take on this challenge too there are some options to try that may solve your phone issues in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll explain some troubleshooting tips for Cisco MPP phones next consider a scenario where your phone was working fine and then the line or extension stopped working as indicated by the red check mark in this network diagram in such instances the first place to start is to make sure your phone is getting an IP address and is connected to the network you can do this by hitting the settings button scroll down to status select Network status and then ipv4 status as you can see the IP address is listed here but if this field is blank make sure the ethernet cable is plugged in correctly in the back of the phone to see that the cable is snug and plugged into the right port for this example the cable is connected to the Lan port on the phone many times the cable could have been plugged into the wrong spot or not plugged in at all it's important to note that without the IP address the phone will not be connected to the network which connects to your phone's service if you're not getting an IP address even after verifying the connection the next step is to isolate the issue you can investigate whether it's the phone Hardware or a network problem such as a bad cable or a DHCP issue to do this move the phone to a known working location in your network where a device preferably a phone is already plugged in and working replace it with the phone that's having problems once connected check for an IP address if you see one then you know that it's probably a cable issue or maybe the spot where it was plugged in does not have a network connection anymore you may also run into a situation where your phone is not working but it shows that it has an IP address what do you do in this situation we make sure that the IP address is reachable from a computer on the same network to do that go ahead and open a Windows command prompt and ping the IP address in this example there's a response which is great next to make sure that you can access the web interface of the device open a web browser type the IP address in the address bar and press enter if you can do this that's helpful because if you're going to need to contact either your call controller or Cisco technical support they will want to be able to access the web interface of your phone on the other hand if you did not get a response on the Ping test one possibility is that your computer may be on another VLAN in the network if this is true you'll want to contact your network administrator once you're logged in to the web interface of your phone scroll down to see if your phone extension is registered as you can see in this example the phone extension is not registered if this is the case you should contact your call controller to find out why your phone is not registered since configurations are set by the call controller it would be the best option to contact for support and configuration issues nice work troubleshooting hopefully you've found the problem in your set and if you haven't you have already rolled out several possible issues you have verified your ethernet connection you isolated the issue to determine if it's a network or a hardware issue you found that the IP address and test it if it's reachable and you are also able to log into the web interface of the device using the IP address if you have any other questions contact your third party call control provider for Cisco technical support see the link in the description below thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "as the saying goes expect the best but prepare for the worst so even if you have a solid plan stuff happens so be ready for it backup plans are always a good idea especially when it comes to business if a network goes down business productivity comes to a halt therefore it's considered a best practice to save a backup configuration for every device this way if your network starts having problems you can use that backup this saves you the time of performing a factory reset and configuring the device from scratch in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll show you how to backup and update configuration files for your Cisco business switch to start log into the switch by entering the username and password click login navigate to administration file management and then file operations as you can see on this page there are three operation types to select so you can update a file backup a file or duplicate a file select duplicate these three options will automatically appear on the screen running configuration which is the file currently running on the switch Startup configuration which is the file the switch uses to start up after reboot and finally mirror configuration which is a copy of the Startup configuration file that's made when the switch has been operating continuously for 24 hours without any changes to the running configuration file when you select the source file to duplicate you'll then see what the options are this is called the destination file name as you can see here if running configuration is checked as a source file the only option for the destination file is Startup configuration if you select Startup configuration as the source file then the only option is running configuration however if you select mirror configuration both running and Startup configuration files are available to be the output for this example I'm going to select the option to duplicate the running configuration file as Startup configuration and then click apply at the top of the screen when the operation is done there should be a success notification at the top of the screen as well as two syslog notification messages that show what I did and that it was done successfully it's pretty simple isn't it now I'll show you how to backup a file on your switch the backup file operation gives you options to select which file you can save as a backup and then copy to another device the source file types that can be backed up are running configuration Startup configuration mirror configuration logging file and dashboard info file for this example I'll choose Startup configuration as the source file I want to back up next you need to choose the copy method right now you can see I'm in basic mode use the drop down to change it to Advanced and you can see all available copy methods HTTP https a USB drive an internal Flash tftp which means trivial file transfer protocol or SCP file transfer via SSH which means secure copy protocol foreign I'll use the HTTP or https option and then choose how to handle any sensitive data in the file click exclude and no sensitive data will be included in the backup if encrypt is selected the sensitive data in the file is included but encrypted to keep it safe if I choose plain text the backup copy will contain all the sensitive data in the backup but only as plain text I'll select plain text and then click apply as you can see the downloaded file is now showing up on the screen as a text file with the name startup-config.txt and again I get the notification that the process was a success along with syslog notification pop-ups as you can see here all I have to do now is go to my downloads folder to get this file and use it to restore the switch configuration lastly I'll show you how to update files click update file notice that there are three destination file types to choose from for this example I'm going to update the Startup configuration file that I just backed up and downloaded earlier I can choose any of the methods available here to copy but today I'll use the HTTP https method to keep it simple if I choose other options then I'll need to configure additional parameters after selecting the file to be updated I now need to go to the location of that file to find it browse for the file by clicking browse next to file name navigate to the downloads folder select the file I previously downloaded and click open and then finally apply when it's done you'll see that success note at the top of the screen and again the syslog notifications on the bottom right which tells you that it was successful notice the red blinking save icon at the top of the screen this is pointing out that there was a change to the configuration file and it needs to be saved it's like it's waving at me and saying hey there don't forget to save the changes you just made so click on that save icon and again you see the success and syslock notifications to let me know everything worked fine now that the Startup configuration file has been replaced you need to reboot the switch to finish the process navigate to the reboot option in the administration panel and click the reboot button to confirm you want to reboot click the OK button and the switch will begin to reboot it takes some time to reboot but eventually the login page will show up go ahead and log in again navigate to status statistics and open the system summary page when you look at system uptime you should see that it's only been up for a few minutes which means the reboot was successful and has just been turned on see that flashing red save icon again at the top of the page go ahead and click on it again to save the newly updated configuration file and you'll see the success in syslog notifications that's how simple it is to make a backup configuration file and then update it on The Cisco business switch as well thanks for watching I'll see you next time

    "transcript": "I have the best mailman no matter what he gets my deliveries to my mailbox it seems simple but if you think about the thousands of houses in town and all that mail it's impressive how does this happen well he follows a planned route switches are the mailman of your network delivering frames to their destination quickly and efficiently on a network these planned routes are based on media access control Mac address tables Mac address tables can be learned dynamically and can also be created with static entries in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll explain how Mac address tables are created on a Cisco business series switch I'll start by explaining how a Mac table is created dynamically in this scenario there are three computers connected to a switch for Simplicity I have labeled the Mac addresses AAA Triple B and Triple C the switch is new so the MAC address table is blank to start the computer with the MAC address of AAA sends a frame to the computer with a Mac address of Triple B when the switch receives the frame it adds the MAC address of the sender AAA as well as the interface on which the frame was received the switch doesn't know the Final Destination yet since the only entry in the MAC address table is the sending device therefore the switch floods the frame out all other ports trying to reach the destination foreign the devices that don't have that destination Mac address don't accept the frames so in this example the computer with the MAC address of Triple C will reject the frame the computer with a Mac address of Triple B will accept the frame and send back a reply through the switch the switch adds the Triple B Mac address and Associated interface to the table moving forward while that address is in the table any frames for Triple B will be sent directly there this is how the MAC address table is populated dynamically if you want to see your current Dynamic Mac address table navigate to the web user interface of the switch select the MAC address tables menu and scroll down to Dynamic addresses here you will see a list along with some options for privacy part of each Mac address has been blurred however you can still see the interface in VLAN ID that are associated with them if you want to erase the entire Mac address list all at once select the clear table option you can search by Mac address if you want to view a specific one the dynamic Mac address table isn't permanent after a certain period of inactivity the entries are cleared the default value for this is 300 seconds but can be adjusted to any number between 10 and 400. so if you want the MAC address to be refreshed more frequently decrease the time alternatively by increasing the Aging time the Mac addresses will be retained for a longer period to change this scroll up and click on Dynamic address settings for this example I'll leave it alone the basics for dynamic Mac address tables next I'll move on to static Mac address tables static Mac address tables are manually entered and always take precedence over Dynamic they're usually configured as a security measure to prevent layer 2 spoofing attacks a spoofing attack is when a hacker spoofs or falsifies a MAC address to change entries in the MAC address table with the goal of gaining access to data in this example if a static entry doesn't exist for the MAC address AAA a hacker could spoof that Mac address and send a packet to the MAC address of Triple B as a result the switch would update the MAC address table with the new interface number packets for AAA would be sent to the new location to illustrate the table now shows the MAC address for AAA connected to interface 3 instead of interface 1. if you use a static Mac address then you can make sure that the MAC address is only available on a certain interface or port to add a static Mac address entry return to the switch web user interface on the left hand side navigate to the MAC address tables menu and select a static address click on the blue plus button specify the MAC address and the interface or port you can also specify a VLAN ID here I'll enter VLAN 1 since it is the only one configured next set up the status which has four options permanent delete on reset delete on timeout and secure in the permanent mode the system never removes this Mac address if the static Mac address is saved in the Startup configuration it is retained after a reboot for the device on reset the static Mac address is deleted when the device is reset the delete on timeout option deletes the MAC address when aging occurs lastly secure is when the MAC address is secure when the interface is in classic locked mode which is associated with Port security and there you go you know how Mac address tables are formed and updated and how to set addresses statically if needed Mac address tables help your switch get the job done right quickly and efficiently because neither snow nor rain nor heat nor Gloom of night well you get it thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "has this ever happened to you sound asleep only to be woken up by a chirping sound you know that sound it's a smoke alarm with a low battery covering your head with the pillow is just not gonna cut it time to get up and figure out which one needs attention the hunt begins you go from smoke alarm to smoke alarm listening for the next chirp hoping to pinpoint the culprit wouldn't it be great if there were a simple way to show you which one needed the Quick Fix luckily this doesn't need to be a situation you have to deal with on a network you can get important information on devices with link layer Discovery protocol for media endpoint devices also known as lldpmed extension configuration it can be configured on your Cisco business switch this protocol facilitates communication with all the devices in your network data is collected from each device this data includes information that identifies and locates devices including phones on your network in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll explain how to configure link layer Discovery protocol for media endpoint devices [Music] thank you when configured on your switch lldp can identify locate and show information about devices in your network if you have a problem with a device you can see its status and location so if needed you can go and work on it directly lldp can be used in networks with both Cisco and non-cisco devices as long as they all support lldp now that you know the benefits I'll dig a little deeper into lldp [Music] lldp is a neighbor Discovery protocol used by network devices to advertise information about themselves to other devices on the network the protocol runs over the data link layer which is how two systems running different network layer protocols learn about each other lldp allows the switch to advertise its identification configuration and capabilities to neighboring devices that store the data in a management information base lldp uses a set of attributes to find and identify neighboring devices the attributes include type length and value descriptions these are called tlvs for short okay now that you know some details about lldp I'll explain lldp Med extension Med is an extension on lldp that operates between endpoint devices such as IP phones and other network devices like switches specifically it provides support for voice over Internet Protocol or VoIP applications Med also provides additional tlvs for capability Discovery Network policy power over ethernet and inventory management and now that you know the basics I'll show you how to configure these lldp Med extensions on your Cisco business switch log into the switch using your username and password change the display mode from basic to Advanced open the VLAN management page to see the vlans on your switch here under VLAN settings you can see the two vlans on my CBS 350 switch VLAN 1 is the default in VLAN 50 is designed for VOIP scroll down the page and Under The Voice VLAN section select properties under the operational status of VLAN 50 check the settings for cos 802.1p which stands for class of service it shows it's configured as five for the voice application here dscp which stands for differentiated Services code point is set to 46. after checking the settings of your VLAN in my case VLAN 50. navigate to the administration menu select Discovery lldp and open the properties page this is how to check the properties of the lldp and make sure it's turned on this page make sure that the lldp status is enabled this page is used to set the general lldp parameters like enabling the features globally and setting timers next navigate to the lldpmed network policy page where you can configure settings for real-time applications including voice and video a couple of points here going forward if a network policy is configured it can be included in the outgoing lldp packets to attached lldp media endpoint device the media endpoint device must send its traffic as specified in the network policy it receives if the lldpmed network policy for voice application is checked it means you can't manually configure these settings as they are set automatically if it is configured how you want then click the apply button in this case I want to define the policy manually so I'll uncheck this auto box the first step to define a new policy is to click the plus icon which then displays this new window labeled add lldpmed Network policy select the network policy as one since it's the first policy you're setting up pick voice from the application drop down menu and then enter the VLAN ID this is where the traffic needs to be sent in this case I'll enter 50. as this VLAN is defined as a voice VLAN on this switch select tagged for the VLAN type which again is for voice traffic user priority or traffic priority is the class of service value to Define next in this case I'll choose 5 for the voice application the next setting is dscp value which is what associates with any application data sent by the neighboring devices in the network this setting tells the neighbors how to Mark the application traffic sent to the device here I'll select 46 as I'm using a voice application at this point the settings are finished click on the apply button here to save the settings to the running configuration file you should see a message on the screen that tells you this new network policy was saved successfully just a note here the interfaces need to be configured manually to include the defined Network policies for the outgoing lldp packets using the lldpmed port settings the next step is to open the lldpmed port settings page so that I can configure the lldp med tlvs if the lldp-med network policy for the voice application is set to Auto and the AutoVoice VLAN 50 is in operation the device automatically generates an lldp-mad Network policy for the voice application for all the lldp ports got the information on this page the user-defined network policy shows that there are two types of traffic defined here active stands for the type of active traffic on the port application means the traffic type for these defined policies and location is where the tlvs are transmitted here Poe which stands for power over ethernet indicates if the poe-psd tlv is transmitted finally inventory shows if the inventory tlv is transmitted the message on the top of the page here shows if the settings are in manual or auto mode and right now this page is in manual mode to change this click on the lldpmed network policy link to open that page here you can select the auto check box and set it to auto mode while in manual mode you can set up and configure additional lldp Med tlvs and one or more user-defined lldp Med Network policies to a port click to select the port and then click on the edit button this page shows all the settings that are available for this port the interface name in this case is ge1 the lldpmed status is enabled right now the SNMP notification is not selected but if you wanted to send smmp notifications on a per Port basis when an Med supported end is discovered click here to enable it the next step is to select the optional tlvs from the ones shown on the left side of this box in this case I'll keep the network policy that's already here for the available Network policies select one voice and then click the right arrow in the middle to move it to the selected Network policies box on the right side there are three fields at the bottom of the page here in each field you need to enter the data in hexadecimal characters these are defined by lldpmed standards each field needs the following information location coordinate enter the coordinate location to be published by lldp location Civic address enter the Civic address to be published by lldp and finally the location ECS Elin which stands for emergency call service and emergency location identification number that will be published by the lldp by default the location is not configured but you can still enter it in hexadecimal format like this today I'm going to leave these fields as they are and then click the apply button again this will save the lldp-mad port settings to the running configuration file you should see the success notification message at the top of the screen this time it also gives a reminder to save the configuration one more check it all looks good close this page and then look at the lldp Port status page to see the global information for every port on the switch one of the things to see here is the ladpmed status for each switch and if it's been enabled don't forget to click on the save icon at the top of the page to save these new settings so there you have it this is how you can view set up and configure the lldpmed extension on your Cisco business switch a great way to keep current information on your devices especially when there is a problem that needs to be addressed

similarly when a destination address is not known broadcast messages get sent out and the network data can get stuck in a loop this uses precious resources and the data doesn't reach its destination this can be even more problematic when stacking switches in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll explain how to prevent Loops using the spanning tree protocol STP on three or more Cisco business switches STP is an essential Network protocol used to prevent looping within a network topology as you can see here this network diagram shows a simple network with two switches and two computers when the switches are connected with one cable it can be a point of failure so to ensure that the network has a better chance of staying up and running you can add a second cable this adds some redundancy which is good however this can create Loops in this example if computer 1 sends an address resolution protocol ARP request looking for computer 2. switch 1 will send out a broadcast on all interfaces except where it was received from computer one this means switch 2 will see both broadcast frames so switch 2 will receive one of the broadcast frames on Port 1 and will send it out to Port 2. likewise the frames received on Port 2 will be sent on Port 1. the other switch will behave in the same manner back and forth forming a loop the packets will continue going back and forth until you either disconnect one of the cables or one of the switches crashes overwhelmed with all the traffic that's coming back STP will help the network become free of loops let me show you how this happens this diagram shows three connected switches to keep things simple I have labeled the Mac addresses as AAA Triple B and Triple C without stb without STP there would be Loops however as a default setting on CBS switches STP is enabled therefore special frames called Bridge protocol data units bpdus will be sent to each other this Frame contains the MAC address and priority called a bridge ID spanning tree requires this bridge ID for its calculation of the root Bridge a root Bridge is a focal point in the network all other decisions such as which port to Black and which port to put in forwarding mode are made from the perspective of this root Bridge to see the spanning tree settings log into the switch and navigate to spanning tree under STP status and global settings make sure the spanning tree state is enabled STP loopback guard is not enabled by default this feature provides additional protection against layer 2 forwarding Loops regarding not receiving BPD use if enabled it can cause more traffic congestion on the switch I'll leave it disabled the STP operation mode is set to Classic STP but there are other options available you can check out the CBS admin guide for more information on these options the bpdu handling is grayed out and set to flooding you cannot change this when spanning tree is enabled is when packets go out to all the switches if you disabled spanning tree you will then have the option to select flooding or filtering this means the bpdus are only going to get forwarded or filtered this is not recommended next default value is in Long mode by default but you also have the option to select short this refers to the 16 or 32-bit value that provides for the speed of the interfaces the long version can account for more options if the speed increases under bridge settings is the priority the default value is 32 768. the hello time has a default of two seconds which means a bpdu is sent that often the max age is set to 20 seconds if you do not receive a bpdu for this time frame you will know something has changed in the network and you'll need to recheck the topology forward delay is the timer used for the listening and learning states of the port it will remain in each state for a duration of 15 seconds now that you know the location for the STP settings on the web UI of the Switch I'll go back to the network diagram to see what STP will do with the bridge ID so taking the bridge IDs into consideration it will elect a root Bridge the switch with the lowest Bridge ID is preferred as a quick reminder 32 768 is the default priority number on all three switches if this is the case then the MAC address will be taken into consideration meaning the switch with the lowest Mac address will become the root Bridge in this simple Network diagram it's AAA therefore switch 1 will become the root Bridge the ports on the root Bridge are always designated on this diagram the letter D represents that the switch is in a forwarding state the other two switches can be referred to as the non-root ridges if you need to find the root Port the shortest path to the root bridge take a look at the speed of the interface each interface has a certain cost the path with the lowest cost will be used here's a quick overview of the interfaces and their costs the ge1 interface on switch 2 and 3 will be the root ports now you know the designated ports on the root bridge and the root ports on non-root Bridges however a loop still exists so you need to shut down a port between switch 2 and switch 3 to break that Loop for this scenario ge2 on switch 3 needs to be shut down both switches have the same priorities but Triple B is the lower Mac address to shut down the switch you can block its Port which will break the loop a labeled here stands for the alternate or non-designated port it's blocked now that the port is shut down the loop problem is solved ge2 of switch 2 will be in a forward State designated as d if you look at the designated route settings in the web interface of the switch the bridge ID and the root Bridge ID will both be AAA as switch a is the root Bridge the root port and the root path cost will both be zero because that information is for the non-root switches which are leading to the bridge if you look at switch 2 the bridge ID will be Triple B and the root Bridge ID will be Triple A the MAC address of the root Bridge switch one the root Port will be the port that leads to the root Bridges it's going to be interface one and the root path cost will be four because this is a 1000 megabits per second speed finally if you look at switch 3 the bridge ID will be the MAC address Triple C the root Bridge ID will be Triple A the root Port again will be 1 and the root path cost will be four when you navigate to STP interface settings in the web UI of the switch you can see more information on the port and edit it if needed the table shows the interface and if STP is enabled or disabled on it edgeport status is displayed and this enables or disables the fast link on the port if fastlink mode is enabled on a port it automatically sets the forwarding State when the port link is up fastlink therefore optimizes the STP protocol convergence the options for this include enabled disabled or Auto the next column is bpdu handling which is STP the port role can be designated alternate or root ports the table also shows path cost and priority of the port by default it's set at 128. the port State displays the current STP state of the port it can be disabled blocking listening learning or forwarding and then there is the designated Bridge ID designated Port ID designated cost and forward transitions you can select one of these interfaces and click on the edit icon to make changes now you know some options for STP and how to configure it on the CBS switches in your network data can get where it needs to go no more loops and no more worries thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "imagine driving down the road heading home from work and you hear an ambulance that ambulance is either rushing to a medical emergency or heading to the hospital with a patient either way it needs to get where it's going as fast as possible it needs priority so you immediately pull over to give them a clear path to their destination on a network quality of service or qos settings can give priority to certain types of traffic that shouldn't be delayed in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll explain how to restrict internet bandwidth for a group of users using qos on Cisco rv340 series routers next to start the configuration log into the router provide the username and password and click login navigate to Lan and then VLAN settings to create a separate VLAN for the users for which you want to restrict the internet bandwidth now click add under the VLAN table to add a new VLAN notice that VLAN 2 has been created the IP address is 192.168.2.1 and the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 next enable the DHCP server you can see the IP address range start and IP address range end for the DHCP server we are enabling for VLAN 2. users connecting to VLAN 2 will get the IP automatically from that IP address range to save the settings click apply VLAN 2 has now been created moving on configure Portland 2 for untagged traffic on VLAN 2. select untagged traffic for VLAN 2 on Portland 2 by clicking edit as a result any PC or laptop can be connected to this support to verify the service untag the traffic on this port since the PC laptop or network interface card cannot process the tagged VLAN traffic click apply to save the changes as you can see VLAN 2 traffic on Portland 2 is untagged so any system can connect to verify this service next navigate to qos and select the traffic classes option to configure the traffic classes traffic classes Channel internet traffic to the desired queue based on the service the service can be layer 4 TCP or UDP Port application Source or destination IP address dscp receive interface OS and device type move over to the traffic table and click add enter the class name as VLAN 2 and 2 underscore VLAN 2 for the description navigate to the service table click add and enter the service name field as two underscore VLAN 2 and Wan 1 as receive interface this is the activewan interface on the router choose ipv4 as the IP version The Source IP will remain as any and the destination IP will remain as VLAN 2. next enter 255.255.255.0 as the subnet mask for the network service application select all traffic from the drop down menu the device type and Os type are not editable so they will stay as any keep the match dscp as any and the rewrite dscp as none click apply to save the settings next to create the traffic class from VLAN 2 to WAN traffic click add under service table and enter the class name as Wan provide the description as to when I will also use the service name as to Wan for the receive interface enter VLAN 2 and ipv4 for the IP version set the source IP to 192.168.2.0 and the subnet mask to 255.255.255.0 for the VLAN 2 Network the destination IP will be set to any value in this case 0.0.0.0 [Music] the service application will be set to all traffic and the device type will be set to any to finish this task click apply to save next navigate to qos and then wan queuing to specify the queuing engine there are three different modes priority rate control and low latency which are mutually exclusive select rate control so that you can Define the minimum and maximum rate for each queue under the WAN queuing table click add to add the queuing policy in the policy name field enter rate underscore VLAN 2 and VLAN 2 for the description under the queuing rate control table select the traffic class for q1 from the drop down menu I will go with Wan and keep the minimum and maximum rates at one percent for this scenario I've limited the internet bandwidth to 10 megabits per second here the capacity of the WAN is one gigabit per second or 1000 megabits per second limiting the maximum rate to one percent or the bandwidth to 10 megabits per second click apply to save the changes these settings May differ from the ones that were just configured it in the bandwidth restriction you want to apply to your network the rate control policy is now visible here next navigate to qos and then when policing in when policing the rate control mode supports eight cues each queue can be configured with a maximum rate for q1 choose VLAN 2 for the traffic class and reduce the maximum rate to one percent to restrict the traffic to 10 megabits per second this is one percent of one gigabit per second which means one thousand megabits per second click apply to save the changes make sure that you have enabled Wan policing for the WAN interfaces as well as a result check the box and then click apply to save the changes the next step is configuring the WAN bandwidth management policy that will be applied to the outbound queuing policy navigate to qos and then Wan bandwidth management the WAN interfaces can be configured with a maximum bandwidth that is provided by your internet service provider when the value or transfer rate in kilobits per second is configured the traffic entering the interface is saved at that defined rate in this section I'll Define the maximum bandwidth provided by your internet service provider or ISP for both the WAN interface and the activewan interface keep the upstream and the downstream traffic for the WAN 1 interface at 10 million kilobits per second which is the maximum capacity for the WAN 1 interface on this router your value May differ depending on the internet bandwidth you use and the WAN bandwidth restrictions you wish to impose I'll select the outbound queuing policy from the drop down as rate underscore VLAN 2 for the wan1 interface the active interface however in your case you may apply for both the WAN interface and any other interface where you want to restrict the bandwidth once you finalize the settings click apply to save the changes now you can see that the changes have been applied you can check when policing to see if it is enabled when the WAN queuing policy is applied to the wan1 interface you can see it in the WAN queuing table navigate to the traffic classes to verify that the traffic class VLAN 2 and Wan are in use to save this configuration to the router's Startup configuration file click on the red blinking save icon this will take you to the configuration management page where you can see that the source is set to running configuration and the destination is set to Startup configuration to save the settings click apply you will get a success notification pop-up on the screen click ok the configuration has been successfully completed and saved you can now test the bandwidth restrictions by connecting your PC or laptop to VLAN 2. these settings keep priority data moving efficiently where it needs to go just like that ambulance thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "imagine you work alone in a coffee shop that's filled with hundreds of customers and you can only serve One customer one cup at a time a nightmare come true right but what if the process could be automated and you could produce multiple unique orders simultaneously the ultimate in multitasking you'd have some happy customers you can think of a Wi-Fi 6 wireless network in the same way that's just one of the features of Wi-Fi 6 that takes your wireless network to a whole new level welcome to the next generation of Wireless technology in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll explain the basics of Wi-Fi 6 available on Cisco business wireless 150ax access points and 151 axm mesh extenders so sit back with a cup of Joe and I'll get you some details [Music] I'll dive in with a basic overview of Wi-Fi 6 and how we can help manage your network so what's different about Wi-Fi six Wi-Fi 6 has new features that increase the overall efficiency of your network one of the new features is called orthogonal frequency division multiple access or ofdma just saying that is a tall order this new feature was created to improve the process of sending and receiving more data across a greater number of channels using different frequencies there are large channels for bulky information and data as well as small channels that are used for smaller amounts of data transmission so when these channels are used in this way they can all be utilized at the same time and still work seamlessly what makes it faster is that the technology has more Lanes of connection so to speak so that it can talk to more devices at the same time for example if you need to upload huge files of graphic images to a site on the internet you'll need a channel that can handle sending these large files easily and quickly ofdma finds the Channel with the largest bandwidth to send your files now what if you need to access your email account at the same time well since emails are much smaller than image files ofdma selects the Channel with the right bandwidth to manage your email account yes that's right you can perform different actions at the same time on a Wi-Fi network without losing speed or connection another new feature is multi-user multiple input multiple output or mu Mimo mu mimo technology allows several devices in your network the ability to communicate with your access point at the same time rather than wait for their turn as described in the coffee shop scenario mimo breaks up the internet bandwidth into separate channels for each device mimo technology essentially creates and opens several Pathways at the same time so all the data can go in or out simultaneously this is helpful when you have a lot of devices in the network that are streaming downloading or uploading data in fact Wi-Fi 6 can support up to 12 streams simultaneously that's a latte in earlier versions if your network was close to another wireless network their signals may have overlapped and interfered with each other causing issues Wi-Fi 6 now uses a technology called basic service set or BSS coloring that identifies all the different networks and then marks each network with a different color this helps your network identify the channels that belong and ignore the ones that don't this way both the access point and the client are less distracted by other networks and ultimately become more responsive and efficient how great is that the next helpful feature I'd like to highlight for Wi-Fi 6 is called Target wait time or twt if you've ever noticed that the batteries in your wireless devices wear down more quickly than you'd like you're in for a treat with Wi-Fi 6 the access point uses twt technology to set up scheduled times on Wi-Fi devices when those devices need to send or receive data when it isn't sending or receiving it goes into sleep mode therefore the battery life is saved on that device last but not least Wi-Fi 6 uses the latest security protocol called wpa3 this security protocol gives you stronger protection against users who may try to access your network it's called authentication protection which means you have greater protection from threats like someone trying to access the network by guessing the password several times amazing Wi-Fi 6 technology helps your wireless network run as quickly and efficiently as possible and it's available on The Cisco business 150 ax APS and 151 axm mesh extenders I can't think of anything better for your business thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "WebEx calling sometimes abbreviated as wxc integrates the normal Cloud PBX features that you'd expect such as phone functionality on hold music call transfers conference calling and more the WebEx infrastructure provides meetings conference room systems instant messaging Duo authentication and other beneficial features in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll show you how to convert an Enterprise phone to use Cisco's cloud-based voice over IP system WebEx calling once that side has been set up the steps in this video show the manual migration method that's recommended for a lab or small number of phones [Music] to start you'll need to make sure your model of phone and firmware version are eligible for conversion this list shows what will work see yours on this list great now there are two websites utilized for this process first is the WebEx control Hub located at admin.webex.com this is where you create an account enter information register the phone and manage the account once everything is configured before you migrate and register a phone your network administrator needs to set up your organization for WebEx calling including creating users and workspaces if you happen to be the network administrator and you need assistance with the configuration of WebEx calling like setting up phone numbers users hunt groups or anything other than provisioning the phone contact the WebEx calling support team for assistance the link is in the description the WebEx control Hub can be accessed once the account has been created the prerequisite list can be found under updates and migrations and then migrate Enterprise phones to MPP firmware the second website called the cloud upgrader is located at upgrade.cisco.com this site explains the prerequisites for the network administrator as well as a migration assistant that explains what to enter onto the phone itself these websites are listed in the description connect the Lan Port of the phone to your network typically a lan port on a router or switch if your phone uses power over ethernet use a Poes port on your switch optionally connect the access port of the phone to your computer with ethernet cables if your phone needs power besides with Poe connect the phone to an outlet log into wxc with an account that has administrator privileges navigate to calling and click the locations tab take note of the name of the location in my case this is site one the location name needs to be entered exactly the same when you fill out the template on a later step navigate to users you can see that the network administrator has some users already set up in this WebEx calling account although no phones are shown for migration scroll down under services and select updates and migrations select the second option for migrating Enterprise phones to MPP firmware once directed to this area you can see some of the migrations that have already been done there are two steps for doing the migration step one the prerequisites should have been done already so you can start with step two click on start a new task give this task a unique name I'll call mine migration test one select next download the CSV template I've already got those downloaded once you have them downloaded open the CSV file named devices this is a template enter the information including the location name you noted earlier delete the sample entries and save with a unique name that you'll remember I'll name mine 7861 wxc migration you can see in my example that I do not add an extension or a phone number my Mac address doesn't have colons and site 1 has been entered for the location on the upgrade page click upload select the CSV file for migration click open and then next eligibility will be checked for this phone once eligibility is displayed click on prepare for migration and then select ok at this point you will see the status as in progress it's important that you do not attempt to do anything to migrate the phone until it states it is ready otherwise you'll run into issues once the migration is ready go over to the Cisco Cloud upgrader website for these next steps choose Enterprise to MPP for WebEx calling only at this point you are at the Run migration step so select that since you are performing a manual migration select that option preferably for a lab proof of concept or if you only have a handful of devices scroll down for the instructions on your phone you need to go into the phone's settings the gear button on the phone select admin settings Network ethernet setup and then ipv4 setup scroll down to the alternate tftp tab by default this is set to no edit to set the alternate tftp to on yes and configure the tftp server 1 to the address listed enter the static IP address specified on upgrade.cisco.com it will show the latest information to enter these numbers you will either have a DOT button connected to the star key or you will need to click the large circular button on the phone for the octets to show for the address this depends on your model of phone once done select validate then apply if you are shown that a trust list is installed select erase wait for the phone to download the configuration it may restart several times once the migration process is complete the phone should be registered to the extension or phone number that was assigned to the user or Mac address in the CSV file [Music] when the line key is green it's registered with an extension that's it the phone has successfully migrated from Enterprise firmware over to MPP firmware for WebEx calling a few quick checks on our WebEx control Hub now that the phone's been migrated you may remember that there weren't any phones shown here earlier now when I navigate to devices that phone is listed and online this is the user that the phone was assigned to additionally if I go down to updates and migrations and select the migration that we just did you'll see there's no errors under the successful tab there's one entry and we can see that the user is online and this shows that the migration was successful [Music] all set you've completed the steps to migrate the firmware from an Enterprise phone to MPP for use with WebEx calling you can make calls on your phone both inside and outside of the office thanks for watching I'll see you next time",

    "transcript": "in the early days of networking messages could be sent in one of two ways a broadcast when a message gets sent to every device or a unicast where a message is only sent to one device at a time these options are not always practical they can be inefficient and use bandwidth unnecessarily that's where multicast comes in multicast sends a single message to a select group of recipients this popular option and how to configure it is what I want to talk about today in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll explain how to configure multicast traffic forwarding on a Cisco business series switch using igmp snooping [Music] to start navigate to VLAN settings under VLAN management take a look at your vlans in this case I'll configure VLAN 115 for multicast and VLAN 1 for default data traffic if you go to Port VLAN membership you can see the VLAN Association of each Port that the multicast server and subscriber are connected to enable the igmp snooping features navigate to the multicast menu and igmp snooping underneath the ipv4 multicast configuration first I'll select VLAN 115 and click the edit button the igmp snooping status should be enabled in my case the switch is acting as a queryer so you won't need to enable the M router port's Auto learn you will instead enable the immediate leave option this can be enabled or disabled without fear of any side effects to igmp snooping when enabled it's made to reduce the time it takes to block unlisted igmp traffic sent to your device Port leave the last member query counter set to the default use Query robustness setting you'll enable the igmp query your status since the switch is acting as a querier you won't use the igmp query or election for this example as you are only using one in this case I'll use version 2 of the igmp query for the query your Source IP address select user defined and choose the IP address of the switch next click on the apply button to save the settings and close the window to enable the bridge multicast navigate to the multicast properties page and make sure that the bridge multicast filtering status is enabled in this example I'll select VLAN 115 and make sure ipgroup address is selected for both forwarding methods for IPv6 and ipv4 next navigate to the multicast router Port under multicast by default the multicast router Port is saved as none on a non-query or switch though the Uplink for the query device will be selected as dynamic under our forward all option the default setting is again none you can keep that the same for all ports forwarding is set as the default for unregistered multicast if you don't want unregistered traffic to be forwarded you can set it to filter for that specific port to verify this configuration I'll use a VLC media player select the stream option and select stream again the file will be found on the second page after clicking next select the RTP MPEG transport stream option and click add I'll enter the multicast IP address and click next here I'll activate transcoding and choose the video h.264 and mp3 mp4 option click next choose stream all elementary streams and finally click stream once it's working any subscriber who has joined the stream will see the multicast group address is reflecting for the respective VLAN under the IP multicast Group address there you have it all the steps to configure and verify multicast igmp snooping on a Cisco business series switch thanks for watching I'll see you next time",

I will select xg1 and xg2 ports for stacking and I will configure unit ID after reset as to on the second switch so it will be the standby next move back to switch 1. navigate to the administration menu and select stack management here also I'll select the stack mode as native stacking the stack topology is chain and the stack active is unit 1. I'll choose the xg1 and xg2 ports for stacking and choose unit ID after reset as one from the drop down menu so it will be the active switch reboot switch 1 by clicking the apply and reboot button click OK on the pop-up notification window to confirm the reboot do the same for switch 2. the switches will take some time to reboot and form a stack once the reboot is done log into switch 1 the active switch navigate to the status and statistics menu on the system summary page scroll down here you can see that the stack has been formed unit 1 is active and unit 2 is on standby exactly what I wanted I'll move the mouse pointer over the xg1 and xg2 ports on both switches here you can see that they show as stack ports now I'll navigate to the port management menu to see that the xg1 and xg2 ports are not showing as Network ports now for unit 2 you can see those details as well now that everything is set click on the blinking red icon on top of the screen to save the configuration that's it you are now running your switches as a stack enjoy the benefits they provide thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "in the second of this two-part series of Cisco tech talk I'll go over general questions that relate to security and remote access for Cisco business dashboard or CBD [Music] The Cisco business dashboard have backdoor access to my devices no when Cisco business dashboard discovers a supported Cisco device it will attempt to access the device using the factory default credentials for that device with the default username and password Cisco or the default SNMP community public if the device configuration has been changed from the default then it will be necessary for the user to supply correct credentials to Cisco business dashboard how secure are the credentials stored in Cisco business dashboard credentials for accessing Cisco business dashboard are irreversibly hashed using the shaw 512 algorithm credentials for devices and other services such as the Cisco active advisor are reversibly encrypted using the AES 128 algorithm how do I recover a lost password for the web user interface UI if you've lost the password for all the admin accounts in the web UI you can reset the password by logging onto the console of the probe and running the CBD probe recover password tool or logging on the console of the probe and running the Cisco business dashboard recover password tool this tool resets the password for the Cisco account to the default of Cisco or if the Cisco account has been removed it will recreate the account with the default password when I connect to the web UI of a device from Cisco business dashboard Network management is the session secure Cisco business dashboard tunnels the remote access session between the device and the user the protocol used between the probe and the device will depend on the end device configuration but Cisco business dashboard will always establish the session using a secure protocol if one is enabled for example https will be preferred over HTTP if the user is connecting to the device via the dashboard the session will pass through an encrypted tunnel as it passes between the dashboard and the probe regardless of the protocols enabled on the device the connection between the user's web browser and the dashboard will always be https why does my remote access session with the device immediately log out when I open a remote access session to another device when you access a device via Cisco business dashboard the browser sees each connection as being with the same web server the dashboard and so we'll present cookies from each device to every other device if multiple devices use the same cookie name then there is the potential for one device's cookie to be overwritten by another device this is most often seen with session cookies and the result is that the cookie is only valid for the most recently visited device all other devices that use the same cookie name will see the cookie as being invalid and we'll log out of the session that's a wrap for our two-part FAQ series thanks for watching I'll see you next time",

    "transcript": "if you're going to do something you want to do it right that's why it's a smart move to have a plan especially when it comes to wireless security in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll explain some security best practices for wireless networks next to properly protect your network there are a few important factors to keep in mind the first step you can take is to hide the service set identifier SSID what's that an SSID is the name of your network that is visible to the public by default you have seen this when you want to connect to a wireless network typically you'll see a long list of wireless networks available they say a complex password is good protection but it's even better if potential hackers don't even know the network is there to hide the SSID on a Cisco business wireless access point navigate to the wireless local area network WLAN option under the wireless settings menu select the WLAN you want to hide click on the edit icon and then yes on the pop-up window under the general tab you can see that the broadcast SSID is disabled for this WLAN you can move the slide bar to the right to enable the SSID and move it to the left to disable or hide the SSID with this set clients need to manually enter the SSID to find it and connect to that SSID the next step for securing your wireless network is to enable data encryption this prevents messages from being read by anyone that is not authorized keeping confidential information private even if messages are intercepted they will not be able to be read because of the encryption to enable data encryption for your WLAN navigate to the WLAN security tab you can see the options for the security type here which includes Wi-Fi protected access WPA2 and wpa3 WPA2 uses the advanced encryption standard AES that uses encryption keys for each client on the network the keys are unique and specific to that client wpa3 uses a more powerful and robust encryption that applies an even more reliable handshake mechanism called simultaneous authentication of equals SAE you can enable wpa3 by moving the sliding bar to the right although wpa3 is the most secure option there are a few reasons to still use WPA2 not all Wireless clients are compatible with wpa3 yet personal pre-shared key for clients is not supported for wpa3 enabled wlans and 802.11r which is used for faster roaming is not compatible with wpa3 in this example I will keep both WPA2 and wpa3 enabled this next tip is probably the most common security measure but it's often skipped you should change the wireless network password or passphrase regularly most cyber security attacks can be prevented by updating and using complex passwords this helps ensure that only authorized devices are connected to the wireless network you can enter the passphrase and confirm it here if you have highly sensitive information this next option is a good way to keep access extremely Limited you can enable Mac filtering to allow only known devices to break this one down every device in a network has a 12 digit unique identifier called a media access control or Mac address you can think of it like a social security number for a device because each one is different this Mac address can be found on the equipment itself for this security option you need to add the Mac addresses for every device that is allowed on the wireless network any other devices will be blocked while Mac filtering is enabled make a list of Mac addresses before you start to find the MAC address of a Windows computer press the windows icon and the letter r at the same time a box labeled run pops up in the window type ncpa.cpl into the search box and click the enter button on the Wi-Fi connection section right click select status and then details here you will see the MAC address once you have all addresses enable Mac filtering by sliding the Mac filtering bar to the right a notification shows that Mac addresses of clients can be added to the primary AP under the local Mac address list this is available on the WLAN users page under the wireless settings menu to allow or block here you can approve or reject access to the wireless network Mac address is not on the list are automatically excluded from the condition the last security measure that I'll go over today is to enable the built-in firewall to use this option navigate to the VLAN and firewall tab here you can see that the enable firewall drop down option is available choose yes there are a couple more options that are enabled with this built-in firewall you can apply an ipv4 and IPv6 Access Control list ACL this will be applied to the wireless client after authenticating to the wireless network in addition the VLAN ACL can be applied if the US VLAN tagging option is selected as yes the VLAN ACL name ipv4 and the ACL Direction need to be selected from the drop down menu wireless routers also include built-in firewalls that stop harmful traffic from entering the network once the settings are finalized click on the apply button to save the settings there you have it some wireless security best practices although none of these security measures are a guarantee of Wireless safety these are some proactive steps that you can take thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

RX the last option is for outgoing traffic from Port 1. TX in this example I'll select both RX and TX now with these settings all traffic passing through Port 1 is copied and carried over rspan VLAN 13 through reflector port 2. moving along you'll need some configurations on the remote switch in my example this is sw2 on this switch I'll also create an rspan VLAN with the same ID of 13. navigate to VLAN management and then VLAN settings to create the VLAN 13. [Music] go to status and statistics rspan VLAN and again select VLAN 13 from the drop down menu under session destinations click the plus icon to create a new session I'll select local interface as the Destination type since I have connected the traffic analyzer to the local Port of sw2 select the physical Port where the traffic analyzer is connected for me that's port 15. select the network traffic enable checkbox so that you can use this port as a network Port as well click apply to save the settings go to session sources to add a new session again make sure to use the same session and destination session you created earlier The Source interface must be the remote VLAN VLAN 13 for me click apply and you should be set great now rspan is configured to carry traffic on both switches to confirm this use a packet capture tool like Wireshark to verify that mirrored traffic is reaching it to distinguish the mirrored traffic coming over the rspan from the actual Network traffic passing through the port you filter packets to show only those generated by the device connected to SW port 1. you can see the actual traffic that is copied and carried by rspan there you have it our span has been configured and verified on both your local and remote Cisco business switches thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "every device in a network needs to have an IP address to send and receive communication you can compare it to the mail room in an office there are two ways an IP address can be assigned the first is to use Dynamic host configuration protocol DHCP this protocol automatically assigns IP addresses to devices these IPS are chosen from a pool of available addresses by default there are 50 addresses in this pool DHCP assigns each device a unique IP in the same subnet preventing conflicts within the pool devices can be added or removed without any issues you can think of these like adding a Post-It as a temporary mailbox as these can change often the second way an IP address can be configured is by manually setting a static IP address this is done on devices that need to have an IP address that doesn't change so they can easily be reached often static IP addresses are assigned to routers servers and printers these mailboxes could be thought of as engraved mail assignments they don't change unless you manually change them most networks use both DHCP and static IP addressing but what if you need more than the default of 50 DHCP addresses or what if you need more addresses for static IP addressing one simple adjustment is all it takes in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll show you how to adjust the pool of DHCP addresses on your RV series router [Music] to adjust your DHCP pool log into the web user interface on your RV series router navigate to Lan and then VLAN settings select the VLAN and click on the edit icon here you will see if the DHCP server is enabled or disabled this is enabled by default as you can see here this is the current pool for DHCP addresses when you adjust this there are a few best practices that are recommended it's best to avoid a pool of addresses that includes addresses ending in dot one or dot 254. as those are often the default IP addresses of devices do not use the last IP address of the ipnetwork pool ending in 255 as that is reserved for the broadcast address if you have static IP addresses in your network be sure you're not setting the DHCP range to overlap with any of them alternatively when you configure static IP addresses be sure to assign them outside the DHCP range take good notes of the devices in your network that have static IP addresses so you don't accidentally give two devices the same IP one last thing if you have an older RV series router you may need to navigate to networking LAN configuration and then server settings DHCP to make this adjustment that's all there is to it a simple process that can meet your needs as they change thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "you've heard of vlans and how they segregate a physical Network into separate broadcast domains today I'm going to talk about a specific type of VLAN you may not be familiar with private vlans private vlans split the primary VLAN domain which is also a segregated Network into multiple isolated broadcast subdomains there can be three types of vlans within a private VLAN primary community and isolated it's like the nesting concept creating vlans inside of VLAN this is an advanced topic if you're just looking to set up regular vlans on your Cisco business switch follow the link in the description to get you to the right place in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll show you how to configure private vlans on your Cisco business 250 or 350 switch next [Music] today I'll be using a CBS 350 switch but the steps are the same for the CBS 250 series as well log into your switch make sure that you're in advanced mode by selecting this option from the drop down menu at the top right hand side of the screen select VLAN management you will already be in VLAN settings where you can add a new VLAN click the add button and enter the VLAN ID number for this example I'll use 100. in the next line give the VLAN a name I'll use management click apply to save now repeat the same process to create two more vlans in my case I'll create 200 and 300. once that's done close the window and you should see the three new vlans that you've created now to configure a private VLAN select private VLAN settings and click add in the pop-up window select the volume that you want as the primary I'm going to use VLAN 100. after that select the isolated VLAN ID from the drop down menu I'll use 200. select VLAN 300 to add to the community VLAN and click the carrot over to the right to add it to the selective community vlans to save these settings click apply close the window here you can see that my primary VLAN is 100 the isolated VLAN is 200 and the community VLAN is 300. keep in mind that you can use multiple vlans for both community and isolated vlans today I'll just use one in each to apply the private isolated VLAN Community VLAN and promiscuous VLAN to the ports on the switch select the interface settings menu under VLAN management select the port you want to configure and click the edit icon in the pop-up window next to interface VLAN mode select private VLAN host for your community and then isolated private VLAN ports or private VLAN promiscuous for the promiscuous ports in this example I'll start with an isolated private VLAN port to do this I'll select private VLAN host for the primary VLAN I'll select VLAN 100 which was configured earlier the secondary VLAN host will be 200i for isolated click apply and close the window you'll see that the configuration on Port ge1 is a private VLAN host as primary VLAN 100 and the secondary VLAN is 200. next select Port 2 to configure the community private VLAN to do this click the port and select the edit icon under interface VLAN mode select private VLAN host the primary VLAN is 100 and in this case the secondary VLAN host is 300C for community click apply to save your settings in the same edit window switch to Port 3 so that you can configure the promiscuous port this way you don't have to exit to select the ports for configuration here select private VLAN promiscuous as the interface VLAN mode once again the primary velian is 100. in this case I'll select both 200i and 300C by holding shift or control and clicking both click the carrot to the right to add them to the secondary vlans when that's done click apply and close the window as you can see in my case both ports ge2 and ge3 have been configured Port 2 is configured as the host with Community Valiant 300. Port 3 is configured as promiscuous with Community VLAN 300 and isolated VLAN 200 for the secondary vlans repeat the configuration for isolated and Community ports for each Port you want to be part of the private VLAN I'll configure a few more ports one for isolated and two more for community now I have Port 4 for the isolated VLAN 200 ports 5 and 6 also have Community VLAN 300. any host on a port that is part of isolated vlans like 200 in this case will not be able to communicate with any other host on any other port any host on a port that is part of a community VLAN like 300 in this example we'll be able to communicate with any other host on that Community VLAN but not with any other community or isolated VLAN hosts you did it you've successfully configured promiscuous isolated and Community private VLAN ports within a private VLAN thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "do you remember when the only way to talk on the phone was to be physically connected to a phone line in the wall in case you're too young to remember it was very restrictive unless you had a really really long phone chord after many advancements mobile phones came out giving people the option to make a call just about anywhere this can be compared to the accessibility of the internet when it first came out every device had to be connected to the internet with wires in order to work then Along Came the game changer Wi-Fi this allowed Wi-Fi enabled devices to connect to the internet without wires ah the freedom if you have ever wanted to know more about Wi-Fi stick around a while in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll introduce Wi-Fi including its definition benefits components and more next [Music] computers smartphones printers video cameras and wearables like smart watches all of these and more can connect to the internet using Wi-Fi a wireless networking technology Wi-Fi establishes a network by allowing these gadgets and many more to communicate with one another a Wi-Fi network is a wireless local area network WLAN that employs Wi-Fi protocols there are many Wi-Fi network benefits I'll start with the benefit of an extended range it makes Computing possible anywhere even with high data rates and sophisticated online applications this characteristic offers Comfort an improved user experience and the opportunity for New Uses and applications another benefit that Wi-Fi allows is scalability assigning login information is all that is necessary to add users to a Wi-Fi network keeping it simple there's no physical infrastructure left standing after users are removed as mentioned earlier Wi-Fi provides device flexibility since Wi-Fi enables the usage of a variety of devices including computers phones tablets gaming consoles and internet of things or iot devices Wi-Fi networks need a lot less Hardware than conventional networks so there is easier installation and maintenance this saves money speeds up installation and frees up more space for networking gear Network management is simplified with a Wi-Fi network Administration can be carried out virtually just like scaling with specialized software visibility user management Network Health monitoring data collection and optimization adjustments may all be made through a single interface embedded systems allow Wi-Fi installed equipment including iot devices with no interface a connection to the internet via a security standard called Wi-Fi protected setup WPS there are some Architectural Components that make up a Wi-Fi network that I'll go over starting with stations stations are components that wirelessly connect to the network each station has a distinct Network address that can either be an access point or an endpoint a basic service set BSS is a collection of stations with network connectivity when two or more wireless devices connect to one another in an ad hoc network without needing a router or access point the group is known as an independent BSS an extended service set ESS is a collection of bss's that are linked together such as in a network with numerous access points a distribution system is a means of connecting access points within an ESS these connections are either wired or Wireless a wireless distribution system WDS may use mesh or its own WDS protocol fixed Wireless is a special form of radio transmission used to connect geographically separated access points an access point is a base station that acts as a hub to which other stations connect access is the station's access to the network ESS allows access points to be connected via ethernet cables or wirelessly bridges are used to connect wlans to lands or access points an endpoint is any end user station a computer a mobile device printer or iot device you may have wondered how Wi-Fi works like broadcast media Wi-Fi carries information over radio waves data is sent in packets containing layers with labels and instructions these instructions along with unique media access control Mac address assigned to the endpoint allow packets to be routed to their intended destination Wi-Fi standards are constantly evolving but each subsequent upgrade is designed to be backward compatible with previous versions security is important especially on a network the most basic way to secure your Wi-Fi is to use Mac addresses to ban unauthorized stations however determined adversaries can join the network by forging an allowed address therefore encryption is the most popular way to secure Wi-Fi several encryption methods have been introduced such as those used in wired equivalent privacy WEP and Wi-Fi protected access WPA ask for authentication WPA2 and wpa3 are currently the standard authentication methods they provide acceptable security when strong passwords are used wrapping up one last thing I wanted to go over is mesh as an option for a Wi-Fi network a mesh Network uses many access points wirelessly connected to each other this extends the range and performance of a Wi-Fi network mesh networks offer multiple possible transmission paths and can use intelligent routing algorithms to manage routing and optimize performance mesh networks help solve the challenge of providing Wi-Fi in large public spaces such as libraries convention Halls stadiums and campuses [Music] there you have it answers to questions you may have had about Wi-Fi connection options keep improving I can't wait to see what's next for watching I'll see you next

    "transcript": "after your network is up and running there may come a time when you want to do some testing troubleshooting or other temporary work this may include adjustments to your vlans luckily vlans are flexible and can easily be adjusted to fit your needs even on IP phones in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll show you how to change the VLAN settings of a Cisco IP phone running multi-platform firmware or MPP foreign for this demonstration I have a router a switch and a Cisco phone connected together I also have three configured vlans on the router and switch VLAN 1 with a network of 192.168.1.0 VLAN 2 with a network of 192.168.2.0 and VLAN 3 with a network of 192.168.3.0 all these networks have a slash 24 subnet mask as you can see they all start with 192.168. the third octet changes with each Network the router acts as a DHCP server and supports the vlans all vlans have a DHCP server giving out automatic IP addresses based on their VLAN membership therefore devices in VLAN 1 will get an IP address from the DHCP pool created for VLAN 1. devices in VLAN 2 will get an IP address from the VLAN to DHCP pool and devices in VLAN 3 will get an IP address from the VLAN 3 DHCP pool based on the IP address assigned you can verify which VLAN is assigned for the Cisco phone as it stands now the phone belongs to VLAN 1 with an IP address of 192.168.1.120 the connection from the switch to the phone is set in trunk mode to change the VLAN membership start by accessing the web interface of your phone this can be done by entering the IP address of the phone in the URL bar this process you need to be logged in as an admin with an advanced view to do so click on admin login and then advanced to verify you have the correct view look at the URL bar it should Now display your phone's IP address slash admin advanced under the voice system tab you can view and adjust the VLAN settings this is where you can statically assign the VLAN enable the VLAN if needed change the VLAN ID to 2. disable both CDP and lldpmed this is because Cisco phones use both Discovery protocols to communicate information such as voice feeling and configuration from the switch once that's set click submit all changes the phone needs to reboot to apply these configuration changes after the phone fully reboots you will probably lose access to the web interface due to the changes made if that happens you'll need to find the new IP address of the phone you can look it up on the phone by pressing the gear icon to access the settings options from here select status Network status and then ipv4 status in this example the phone received a new IP address of 192.168.2.120 since the phone is showing an IP address in a different network this is verification that the Cisco phone has changed its VLAN membership to VLAN 2. to further verify that the phone is in VLAN 2. enter the new IP address to access the web user interface look under the info and then status tab under phone status you can see that the operational VLAN ID is 2. that's all there is to it now you can change the VLAN membership of your Cisco MPP phone at any time thanks for watching I'll see you next time",

Cisco RV series routers have a default IP address of 192.168.1.1 to check the IP address assigned to your system open a command prompt type ipconfig and press enter in this example my system ethernet adapter is configured with one IP address 192.168.1.90 this is in the correct subnet to verify the reachability of the Switch I'll ping its IP address 192.168.1.254. I'm getting responses so there's connectivity great everything is ready for access to the web UI of the switch to do this open a web browser I'll use Firefox type the IP address of the switch and press enter by default the browser will try to access the switch via http to access the switch via https click on the secure browsing https button you may get a warning message that shows a potential security risk ahead click on Advanced to see more details about that warning it's showing that 192.168.1.254 uses an invalid security certificate the certificate is not trusted because it is self-signed by default Cisco business devices have a self-signed certificate installed in this case the browser is not trusting that certificate there are two options to fix this warning the first is to add an exception on this browser to bypass the certificate warning to add an exception on the browser to bypass this warning navigate to settings and type certificate in the search box now select view certificates on the certificate manager window make sure that servers is selected click on the add exception option in the location box enter https colon forward slash forward slash and the IP address of the switch 192.168.1.254 select get certificate and the confirm security exception option it's showing the lifetime of that exception as permanent leave that as it stands and click ok close the browser reopen it and type in the IP address of the switch press the enter button again the browser tries to connect the switch via http select secure browsing https since you already added the exception on this browser to access the switch IP via https you should no longer get that certificate error enter the username and password and click login to access the switch the second option to eliminate the certificate warning is to obtain and install a root certificate in this system the required certificate needs to be installed on The Cisco business device this is done using its web UI in this example I've connected to my Cisco Business Wireless cbw setup via my wireless adapter you can see the IP address of the wireless interface by using the ipconfig command it's showing the private IP address configured on my wireless LAN adapter my cbw setup is configured in that IP pool access the cbw web UI open a browser I'll use Microsoft Edge type the URL https colon forward slash forward slash Cisco business dot Cisco and press enter via this URL I can access my cbw access point I have one installed certificate on the cbw device as well as one root certificate on my computer that's the reason I'm not getting a certificate warning when I access my cbw deployment I can see the connection is secure from a notification on the browser click the lock icon on the address bar now you can click on the login button enter the username and password configured on your cbw setup and click sign in now you can access the CDW web UI once you're logged into the web UI of a device you can do configurations or make changes as needed you are in control thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

edition of Cisco tech talk I'll explain some Catalyst 1200 and 1300 features and configurations next [Music] I'll begin by covering the global LEDs on the switch when the switch is powered on and Performing self-tests or acquiring an IP address the system LED lights flash steadily green if the LED flashes Amber the switch has detected one of the following a configuration file error a hardware failure or a firmware failure the switch comes with the factory default IP address of 192.168.1.254 and a subnet mask of Slash 24. when the switch is using this factory default IP address the system LED continuously flashes you will see a steady green when the switch is using a dynamic host configuration protocol DHCP server assigned IP address this is typical since DHCP is enabled by default if you have configured a static IP address you will also see a steady green LED the c1200 and c1300 switches provide a simple intuitive dashboard that automates switch deployment monitoring and life cycle management a resource utilization graph the system Health display and a brief overview of the ram logs are easily accessible next I'll walk you through the process of installing and managing your device to get started you need to log into the web user interface connect your computer to one of the switchboards with an ethernet cable make sure everything is powered on your computer needs to be on the same IP subnet of the switch any address from 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.253 if it is not you will need to temporarily change the IP address on your computer from that IP pool open a web browser and enter the IP address of the switch 192.168.1.254 this is the default address when you first log into the switch the username and password are both Cisco and all lowercase letters after this initial login you will have to change both the username and password once that is set head to the configuration wizard section of the navigation pane from here you can configure the switch by using the various links and following the on-screen instructions let's run the getting started wizard you can use the default hostname or create a new one this screen can be used to generate a new IP address the systems interface choosing none will keep the current settings the system clock can be set using a simple Network time protocol sntp server alternatively the date and time can be imported from a local computer now you can move on to the VLAN Setup Wizard here you can select the interface that will serve as your trunk interface Port 9 will be used in this example since it is connected to my router you can also use this panel to create a new VLAN I'll designate VLAN 10 as admin Port 9 will serve as the trunk port for untagged VLAN 10 traffic VLAN 10 can also have access interfaces added to it on this switch I will choose ports 5 and 6. to examine the file management for the switch navigate to administration file management and then firmware operations a file management system application will organize and save the access files on your device these system files include configuration data and the firmware image here you can manage the firmware file that is used with the reboot modify configuration files internally and copy files to and from an external device [Music] for this next feature select Administration and then the system log section select log settings by default system logs are enabled system logging allows a device to produce multiple independent logs each log is a collection of messages that describe system events the pin utility is another useful feature of the switch a ping test sees if a remote host can be reached and notes the round trip time for each packet sent ping works by sending internet control message protocol or icmp Echo request packets to the Target host once sent it waits for an icmp Echo reply when it is received it calculates the round trip time and Records any packet loss power over Ethernet or Poe can be very beneficial on the switch if you can power devices with the switch it can eliminate expensive wiring reduce the number of cables and easily expand the network the c1200 and c1300 series switches support IEEE 802.3az standards IEEE 802.3bt Poe and IEEE 802.318 Poe plus up to 30 watts per Port the poe power allocation is dynamic and power mapping scales up to a maximum of 740 watts of Poe plus power intelligent power management allows for flexible power allocation across all ports with Perpetual Poe the poe plus power is maintained during a switch reload the last feature I want to highlight is web-based Authentication this feature provides a consistent interface to authenticate all types of host devices and operating systems eliminating the complexity of deploying IEEE 802.1x clients on each endpoint there you have it this has been a quick overview of the Catalyst 1200 and 1300 switches thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "behind the scenes of a network switches are performing all kinds of tasks they connect Network segments facilitate communication and prevent Loops switches also gather forward and filter information about the network one of the protocols used for this is the simple Network management protocol SNMP this protocol is an industry standard for managing and monitoring hardware and software from almost all manufacturers including Cisco Juniper Microsoft and VMware switches learn about the network through SNMP polling CDP and lldp SNMP polling is the process of querying a device that supports SNMP and then retrieving the management information base MIB data to check for problems with behavior or connection SNMP can be used to fetch information from the network device and configure parameters on the devices as well this information might include its present State configuration and statistics if you've been getting slow performance or crashes when using your CBS switch it could be from this process happening too often in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll explain how excessive SNMP polling can cause high Central Processing Unit CPU utilization and how to check or adjust this on a Cisco business switch next foreign to see the CPU utilization in Cisco business switches log into the switch with the putty application and type the command show CPU utilization currently the CPU utilization on my switch has been at two percent for the past five seconds and the last minute for the last five minutes it is showing at four percent this is without SNMP polling now I'll apply some SNMP polling on my Cisco business 350 switch and check the CPU utilization before I do that I need to make sure that the SNMP service is enabled to check this log into the web user interface of the switch navigate to the SNMP menu and select the communities option here you can see that SNMP is enabled on the switch the community string is also configured for the SNMP Management station make sure yours is configured verify the ipconfigured on the switch this is required for SNMP polling for this example the IP is configured as 172.19.1.1 for the VLAN 1 interface I'm using one MIB browser for SNMP polling on this browser enter the IP address of the switch in the address field click on the advanced option to specify the SNMP port number the read and write community and the SNMP version the right Community is not required to read information from the switch after that under the MIB tree select the desired object ID or subtree from which you want to get information and or parameters this is located on the left panel I have selected sys dscr short verb system description for this example now I'll select the get bulk options from the operations drop down menu you can now see the switch system name uptime capabilities and other parameters that are part of the system subtree this is just a small set of queries I can see the current CPU utilization on the switch using the show CPU utilization command currently the CPU utilization is showing seven percent for the past five seconds and three percent for the past one and five minutes I can run that command a couple more times to see the CPU utilization it's almost the same or even less than before this shows that SNMP polling isn't a factor with a small set of queries next I'll execute an extended SNMP query to the switch and check the CPU utilization before I start that process I'll clear the earlier results I'll select the complete MIB tree showing on the left panel this will request many more parameters from the switch as shown under each section of the subtree I'll select get subtree from the operations drop down menu this will be a long process because a lot of information will get fetched from the scroll bar showing on the right side of the screen you may notice that I'll check the CPU utilization on this switch again using the same show CPU utilization command you can see how the current CPU utilization on the switch has jumped to 76 percent for the last five seconds oh boy that quick increase was due to the excessive SNMP polling that might cause issues on the network again I'll run that command now it's at 78 that value will eventually influence the percentage for the one minute and five minute Mark as well I will run that command a couple more times to see the CPU utilization on the switch it is reducing slowly since most of the queries have already been executed I'll stop the SNMP polling and clear the table just for a clean slate the CPU utilization on the switch has been reduced to nine percent now and for the last minute the value has increased to 55 percent that was when the queries were running on the switch to see the CPA utilization percentage decrease I'll run the command a few more times the last one minute is showing as 10 and 5 minutes at 15 percent you've now seen for yourself how excessive SNMP polling causes high CPU utilization on Cisco business switches leading to packet drops and other issues so be careful when you're configuring SNMP polling on your network and adjust it as needed thanks for watching I'll see you next time foreign foreign

I'll give it the name marketing to exit from this specific VLAN interface configuration mode I'll enter the exit command The Prompt is back in global configuration mode to configure a range of vlans in this option enter the command interface range VLAN 13-16 the v in VLAN needs to be capitalized you can enter the VLAN IDs without a space if you choose now I'm in the VLAN interface configuration mode for the vlans 13 through 16. you may log into another VLAN interface from here or create another range of vlans here I'm adding VLAN 17 through 19. I will add the space after the VLAN keyword to show that adding a space here is also acceptable enter the command end when you are done creating vlans and want to go back to privilege exec mode once you have all your vlans created enter one last command of copy running Dash config startup Dash config this saves all the new configurations there you have it it's for configure work using C C thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

I can click on the edit button for lag 1 to see the members details of that leg Dynamic legs on the CBS 350 support up to a maximum of eight active members the active members in this example are one through eight specifically gigabit Ethernet one slash one one to one slash eight standby members are the gigabit Ethernet one slash nine and one slash 10 ports navigating to port management and then the port settings option you can see the operational status of port numbers 1 to 10 are showing as up they are all part of that Dynamic lag to demonstrate how changes affect a dynamic leg I just removed port number seven now port number nine will be added to the active members list and Port 7 will show a status of down I'll refresh the page to see those details that's all there is to it now you know the difference between a static and a dynamic lag how they function and how they can work for you thanks for watching I'll see you next time foreign [Music]",

I'll choose the US VLAN tagging as yes and enter the VLAN ID as 2. for this example I will not touch the traffic or scheduling settings click on the apply button you can see that my guest underscore Wi-Fi WLAN has been created for the last step in this first video you need to create the WLAN users under wireless settings select WLAN users click on the add WLAN user button enter a username I'll enter guest one the password and the confirmed password make sure your guest user option is enabled optionally you can provide the description click apply and repeat the process to create another user I'll name this one guest 2. enable the guest user toggle enter the password confirm the password and description and click apply repeat as needed when complete click on the red save icon on top of the screen to save the settings on your cbw access point click ok [Music] great you're well on your way the next video will get you to the Finish Line click the link in the description to see the next steps thanks for watching I'll see you soon [Music]",

    "transcript": "switches are important and Carry Out vital tasks in a network if things are not working quite the way they should or you want to apply configuration changes a reboot may be just what you need there may even be a time when your switch needs a totally fresh start and should go back to the factory default settings either way I've got you covered in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll show you how to perform a reboot or factory reset on a catalyst 1200 or 1300 switch [Music] Catalyst 1200 and 1300 switches allow for both a manual reboot and a factory reset it's important to remember that rebooting the switch deletes the running configuration so unless you want to redo any configurations since the last reboot you should save the running configuration to the Startup configuration before you proceed the most efficient way to reboot the switch is to press and hold the reset button on the device for less than 10 seconds that's it if you don't have physical access to the switch you can perform a reboot using its web user interface to perform a reboot this way log into the switch navigate to Administration and then reboot you can choose to reboot the switch immediately at a specific date or time or a set time I'll choose immediate if you want to restore the device to factory default settings or clear the Startup configuration the next time it boots up you have the option to select it here I don't want to restore to factory default so I'll make sure that box is not checked once you've selected your preference click reboot next I'll show you how to manually reset the Catalyst switch to factory default this deletes all configurations that have been changed from the default settings some of the main reasons for a factory reset are if a reboot doesn't help the device to run correctly and the solution isn't obvious or you received a switch that another person in the company used and you need to clear the configuration and start over to begin disconnect all ethernet cables from the switch with the power on press and hold the reset button for more than 10 seconds when the process completes connect your computer directly to access the switch using an ethernet cable to connect properly you will need to make sure that your ethernet interface has an IP address in the same subnet as the switch to check or modify this on your Windows PC select control panel network and internet and network connections select the ethernet interface then TCP ipv4 properties enter an IP address somewhere in the range of 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.253 choose an address that is not already in use in this example I've set my ethernet address to 192.168.1.252 the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 and the default gateway the switch is 192.168.1.254. once you're done click OK and close the windows select and open a web browser enter the IP address of the switch in the address bar the default IP address of the switch is 192.168.1.254. once connected the switch will prompt for a username and password the default username and password are Cisco all lowercase configure a new password for better protection of your network enter Cisco in the old password field and enter your new password in the new password and confirm password fields click apply once prompted by the pop-up message click ok click the blinking save icon to save these settings to the Startup configuration file that's all there is to it now you know a few simple ways to perform a reboot or factory reset on your Catalyst 1200 or 1300 switch thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "Network address translation Nat converts private local area network Lan IP addresses into public IP addresses so they can communicate with devices outside the land it may sound complicated but just like an administrative assistant keeps business flowing Matt gets the job done well in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll explain Network address translation Nat thank you today I'd like to compare Matt to an outstanding Administrative Assistant I'll call him Nate the office where Nate works is its own little Community everyone in the building can share resources and communicate with each other quickly and efficiently they don't need Nate to interact with each other but when communication needs to go outside the office that's when Nate gets busy he handles all incoming and outgoing messages if an employee wants to send a letter to someone outside the office Nate replaces the employee's name and office number with the building address and a unique identifier he keeps track of the correspondence by creating a record it Maps the unique identifier to the original employee and their office number when a response arrives at the office building he looks up the unique identifier retrieves the corresponding employees details and delivers the response to the appropriate office similarly in a network using mat when a device from the private Network wants to communicate with the internet the NAT device assigns a unique identifier port number to the outgoing message replacing the private IP address of the device with the public IP address of the NAT device the NAT device keeps track of these translations in a table when a response arrives from the internet the nap device refers to the table and replaces the public IP address with the private IP address of the intended recipient it then forwards the response to the correct device in the private Network so just like Nate manages the communications for his office building that manages the flow of messages between devices in a private network with the internet now you may be wondering why all this translating needs to be done why not just give every device a public IP address to explain this I'll go all the way back to the late 1980s every device that connected to the internet used Internet Protocol version 4. when created ipv4 had over 4 billion unique public addresses available which sounds like plenty but it wasn't enough the pool of public addresses wasn't going to last and a new plan was needed by the early 90s Nat was created as a temporary solution a permanent solution was created in the late 1990s IPv6 ipd6 provides an additional 340 unit decillion unique IP addresses never heard of a number that big me neither now there are plenty of addresses available but many places still use Nat a big reason is for security and privacy Matt acts as a barrier between the internet and the devices within a private Network it hides the internal IP addresses of devices making them inaccessible from the outside Network this provides a layer of security by preventing direct communication with internal devices and helps protect them from certain types of attacks Nat also simplifies Network design by allowing organizations to use private IP addresses internally this saves money as well as the hassle of managing a large number of public IP addresses Nat can assist the transition from ipv4 to IPv6 by providing IPv6 connectivity for ipv4 devices this technique known as nat64 or IPv6 to ipv4 translation enables IPv6 only networks to communicate with ipv4 networks wow that really plays a crucial role in optimizing IP address usage enhancing security enabling connectivity and facilitating the transition to newer Network protocols just like Nate Nat is invaluable thanks for watching I'll see you next time foreign [Music]",

    "transcript": "in computer networking a subnet refers to splitting a single Network into multiple smaller networks to illustrate the concept I'll compare a network with many devices to a town with many houses each house has its own unique address just like every device has its own unique IP address the town is split up into subdivisions the subdivisions are still part of the town but they probably have some characteristics that are unique there may be special rules that have to be followed there may be specified services that are provided based on the members that live there and information specific to that subdivision will be sent out just to them and not everyone in town the subdivisions in the town are like subnets on a network there are times when it's helpful to divide a big Network into smaller networks in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll explain subnets and how they work next [Music] why segment your network into subnets subnets are an efficient use of IP addresses they manage Network traffic more effectively broadcast traffic that is relevant to one subnet only needs to be sent to that subnet subnets also provide the benefit of security creating barriers between different sections of your network devices in separate subnets won't be able to communicate with each other unfortunately nothing is perfect subnetting can get complicated to configure or adjust now with every subnet there needs to be a specified subnet mask the subnet mask distinguishes the portion of the IP address that is the network portion as well as for hosts there are two ways to represent a subnet mask in dotted decimal notation or with a slash so so in a /24 network the first 24 bits the first three octets of the IP address should all be the same since the subnet mask shows 255 for each that designates the network portion the zero in the last octet shows the host portion for a long time all networks were either a sl8 sl16 or sl24 these were called classful networks when a network didn't require all the addresses the rest went to waste about 30 years ago classless interdomain routing cidr was introduced and subnetting became an option this game changer allowed you to create subnets of different sizes helping conserve IP addresses and provide more efficient routing you can create subnets for class A through Class C networks for Class C this is a table of the subnet options notice how how the subnet mask changes in dotted decimal and slash notations as more subnets are added as you add sub networks the number of hosts available for each Network goes down on a side note a slash 31 is only used in point-to-point links for this topology I have a wireless router a switch and three endpoint devices or hosts I'm using a Class C network of 192.168 8.1.0 with a subnet mass of 255.255.255.0 which can also be represented as a /24 the wireless router switch and pc1 are part of this same IP subnet so they'll be able to communicate with each other however laptop 1 will not be able to communicate with the other devices as it belongs to a different network address the three in the third octad shows that PC2 will not be able to communicate with the switch as they are in different IP subnet if you want to enable communication between laptop 1 and the rest of the network you simply need to change its Network address change the IP address of laptop 1 to 192.168.1.0 with a /24 and that's all there is to it for PC2 you simply change the subnet mask to /24 and you're set after these changes both laptop 1 and PC2 can communicate across the network having control over your network can be powerful now you know what subnets are and how they can work for you thanks for watching I'll see you next [Music] time",

In this episode of Cisco Tech Talk, I'll show you how to upgrade the firmware of Cisco Catalyst 1200 and 1300 switches. Next, [Music] In this example, I'm using a Cisco Catalyst 1300 switch, but the same steps apply to the 1200 models as well. The current firmware can be viewed by navigating to status and statistics. Under system summary, the active image of the switch will be listed. Now that you know the current firmware of the switch, the first step in the upgrade process is to navigate to the administration menu. Click on file management and select firmware operations. In this example, the active firmware version is showing as 4.1.0.62. To download the latest firmware of the switch, go to the website software.sisco.com. Here, the latest firmware version for the Catalyst 1300 switch is listed as 4.1.0.72. If you're upgrading a Catalyst 1200 switch, be sure to download that file instead. Click the download button beside the correct firmware image. After the download is complete, navigate back to the firmware operations menu in the UI of the switch. For this example, I'll select update firmware as the operation type and http/https as the copy method. I'm using http/https because it's an easy and quick method to upgrade the firmware. To choose the file name, click on the browse button and navigate to the folder where you have downloaded the latest firmware image file. Click the apply button. The process to transfer the file onto the switch will take some time. Once the file gets uploaded, you will see a success notification on the screen as well as a SIS log message stating the same. At this point, it's important to reboot the switch. That puts the newly upgraded firmware into effect. To do that, navigate to reboot in the main menu. Select immediate as the reboot option and click the reboot button at the top of the screen. Click okay to confirm the reboot process. When it completes, log back into the switch. Navigate to the status and statistics menu. Under system summary, you can verify that the latest firmware version is listed as the active image. It's as quick and simple as that. your Switch is up tod date with all the enhanced security, latest features, and bug fixes available. Be sure to check for updates again in the future. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time. [Music]",

    "transcript": "Enterprise phones are configured to only work with a Cisco unified Communications manager cucm sometimes the needs of a business change so Cisco has come up with a process to migrate certain models of 7800 and 8800 series phones so they can use WebEx calling or other thirdparty call controllers 3pcc after migration the phone will run multiplatform firmware MPP if if you would like your phone to use WebEx calling a link to a video on that process is in the description there are a few different ways to perform the conversion process but the simplest way is to use the cloud upgrader site at upgrade. cisco.com in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll show you how to migrate an Enterprise phone to use multi-platform firmware MPP using a classic license and the Cisco Cloud upgrader next [Music] the first thing you need to do is make sure your phones are available to migrate to check the most recent list navigate to The Cisco phone conversion guide the link is in the description scroll down and check the model of your phone and the version to make sure it's possible once you have confirmation you need to order and obtain a classic migration license from a Cisco partner one for each phone they're sold in bundles if you have more than a few phones the license options are shown under the Enterprise to MPP conversion other call controls section you'll notice there is one license for the 7800 phones and another for the 8800 models both of them have e2m in them this signifies that the license is for the conversion from Enterprise to MPP after you order the license you will get an email with instructions to associate the license with the MAC address of the phone each license must be bound to the MAC address of a specific phone when that's complete you will get an email with a file that contains the license file it ends inic be sure to save the file navigate to upgrade. cisco.com and click Enterprise to MPP for broadworks and other thirdparty call controllers the first step here is to upload the migration license click choose file select the license file and click upload when you see the success notification the license has been uploaded to the Cloud upgrader app there are a few options for migration I will be doing a manual migration of just one phone if you're going to be converting a lot of phones it's more efficient to do a bulk migration however it's recommended that you start with just one one or two phones for proof of concept first for the conversion to be successful you may need to adjust some firewall settings this is done to make sure your network will allow the IP addresses and domains used by the cloud upgrader for the migration so if your firewall supports URL filtering be sure to allow the following URLs Cloud upgrader webex.com ports 6970 443 activate. cisco.com ports 443 activation. webex.com ports 443 you should also make sure that your network has DNS resolution and internet connectivity from a voice VLAN the next requirement is to make sure to have the Enterprise firmware on the phone updated to a minimum of the version shown on the cloud upgrader site the version varies between models to check which phone model model and firmware you have press the settings button on the phone select product information upgrade if you do not have the minimum version shown for your model now that all the preparations are set it's time to perform the migration head over to your phone press the settings button select admin settings and then either Network and or ethernet setup depending on the model of the phone click ipv4 setup scroll down and set the alternate tftp to on or yes and click the tftp server one box depending on the model four boxes may be shown enter the IP address from the cloud upgrader site at the time of filming that is 31421 11.49 if you enter them into boxes you do not need to add the dots click apply select ER race if prompted that a trust list is installed on the phone wait for the phone to download the firmware it will restart several times and may take up to 15 minutes before it boots up with the MPP firmware as soon as the migration process is completed the phone will prompt for an activation code this means it's ready to connect to a thirdparty call controller to verify this click the settings button then status and product information the product name will have 3 PCC in it there you have it this phone is set if this was your proof of concept you're on your way if you'll be doing a bulk migration next it's recommended that you start with small groups of phones and work your way up to larger groups just in case issues come up thanks for watching I'll see you next [Music] time",

    "transcript": "many years ago if you worked in an office you were expected to be sitting at your desk next to the same people at the same time every weekday it was very predictable since then there have been a lot of changes between the pandemic advancements in technology job sharing business travel health concerns and more some people rarely make it to the office it's hard to keep track of who even works there to keep everything efficient many companies provide employees with a unique identification card that includes their name job details and other credentials it's a simple way to be able to see the role that employee has at the company and where they belong similarly with each Cisco switch series there are many different models offered each with a unique product ID this ID can help identify the model features capability and how it might fit into your network puzzle it's a simple code but it carries a lot of important information so with all the options when it comes to choosing a CBS switch knowing the meaning of the product IDs can help make your decision more efficient in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll explain Cisco business switch product IDs pids next [Music] before I dig in I wanted to share this overview of the functionality between the four different models in the current Cisco business switch series the CBS 110 220 250 and 350 I will go into more detail moving forward as I explain the variables within the product IDs this next visual highlights the various options within the product IDs for the Cisco business switches the characters in Black are the same for every product ID the variables are shown in green CBS is the abbreviation for Cisco business switches the A and V variables go together to define the product model when the value is 1 one it represents the CBS 110 unmanaged series switches that are Layer Two a value of 22 is for this CBS 220 smart light series switches which are also layer 2 when the variable is 25 it represents the CBS 250 series switches these are smart manag switches that support layer 3 static routing finally if the variable is 35 this represents CBS 350 series managed switches these switches support layer 3 Dynamic routing in general and in this case the higher the model number the greater the capabilities and price point check the data sheets for each to see more details about each model the next variable B indicates the number of downlink ports the options may include 5 8 12 16 24 and 48 for the number of ports you need to think about how many devices you are planning to connect to the switch now and potentially in the future W denotes the downlink speed if nothing is shown for this variable the ports have 1 GB of speed the downlink speeds that will show on the CBS product ID include M mg n NG and x m switches have 2.5 GB ports mg has a combination of 1 and 2.5 gig ports n switches have 5 GB ports NG has a mix of 1 and 5 gig ports and X switches have 10 gbit ports the next variable is C which indicates the port type the possible values here include t s p PP and FP T represents copper s is for fiber P denotes the power over ethernet Poe support PP stands for partial Poe support and FP indicates full Poe support the next variable y defines the form factor or the power supply type if nothing is listed here the switch power supply unit PSU is internal a value of D signifies a desktop external PSU that is not rackmountable a value of e represents an external power supply these models have smaller enclosure sizes so they can better fit into small spaces like desks meeting rooms or classrooms the last variable Z denotes the Uplink Port type the values here could be 2G 2x 4G or 4X 2 G switches have two one gig ports that do not have stacking capabilities two x switches have two 10 GB ports that support SFP 4G switches have four 1 gig ports that do not have stacking capabilities either 4X switches have four 10 gig ports with SFP Plus in both the 2X and 4x series stacking is supported on CBS 350 series switches only okay that's all the variables to see it in action I'll grab a random product ID to decode I I've selected a CBS 110 8 PD here CBS 110 represents a Cisco business 110 unmanaged switch with eight down lick ports the PP stands for partial Poe support and the D indicates it's a desktop external power supply for another example check out the CBS 220 8fp e2g this CBS 220 smart light switch has eight download L ports and supports full Poe the E represents the external PSU 2G indicates two 1 gig Uplink ports the format is the same for CVS 250 and 350 series switches as well One Last Detail I would like to point out is that at the end of a product model number the country and region suffix is used to further Define the product this is due to slight variations between different countries due to their specific standards or regulations so when you order Cisco equipment make sure you have the correct suffix for compatibility with local infrastructure and requirements here is a list of them that's all there is to it you can now decode the product ID of any CBS switch use these skills to choose the one that will fit best into your network thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "in today's digital age understanding the flow of data within a network is crucial for maintaining its health and efficiency the onboard packet capture OPC tool lets you capture and analyze data packets that are transmitted across a network it's particularly useful for troubleshooting issues or monitoring Network performance in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll explain onboard packet capture OPC via CLI on Catalyst 1200 and 1300 switches starting with version 4.1.3 next I'll start by explaining some parameters starting with capture points when you set up a capture point you are essentially defining a policy or a set of criteria that determines which packets will be captured this can include the direction of traffic incoming outgoing or both or specific types of packets they are essentially designated spots within the network where data packets can be collected for analysis you can only have one capture Point active at any given time a maximum of four capture points can be configured on a switch the capture points are configured in privileged exec mode on the switch they are not saved to the switch's configuration files and do not persist after a reboot a capture is allocated to a maximum of 20 MBT of memory it can be stored in memory and then saved to the onboard flash memory of the switch provided there is enough free space or to an external attached USB flash drive it's important to note that it may use a considerable amount of CPU resources so it's recommended this feature is used only when necessary now I'll go over the commands you will use for OPC on a Cisco Catalyst 1200 or 1300 switch to start it is recommended that before starting a packet capture you check CPU utilization with the command show CPU utilization you can verify the firmware version by typing the command show version in privileged exec mode to create a capture enter the command monitor capture followed by the name of the capture such as cap one which I will reference as its name moving forward when a capture point is created you can view its details with the command show monitor capture to remove a capture Point use the command no monitor capture followed by its name it will delete that specific capture point to verify it is gone enter a show monitor capture command the reply of no capture exist confirms it for buffer related settings the command is Monitor capture cap 1 buffer then specify the size and buffer mode which can be either linear the default or circular the default buffer size is 5 mbes the minimum buffer size is 1 and the maximum is 20 in this example the buffer size is 4 mbes to view buffer details use the command show monitor capture cap 1 buffer the details will be listed to clear the buffer enter monitor capture cap 1 clear which will prompt you for confirmation enter y to specify the source interface for the capture enter monitor capture cap 1 followed by The Source type which is currently only supported for the control plane you also need to specify the direction of the packets to capture which can be inbound outbound or both the capture filter settings are mandatory although with this first release filter operations are not yet supported so for now set parameters using the any option this full command is Monitor Capture One cap 1 match any when ready start the packet capture with monitor capture cap 1 start to stop the capture enter monit monitor capture cap 1 Stop once the capture is done you can save the data from the buffer which is Ram to either the switches onboard flash or a USB storage device this is done using the monitor capture cap 1 export command followed by the destination path I'll save it to flash a success notification verifies that it has been saved I'll save it to USB as well to see the location of these files navigate to the web user interface of your Catalyst switch select administration file management and then file directory you can see that the packet capture file has been saved to both The Flash and USB drives as of version 4.1.3 you cannot open and view this file on the switch itself but you can transfer it to a laptop or PC for further analysis that's all there is to it nice you have a convenient way to collect and store packet data for monitoring and troubleshooting on your Catalyst switch thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "Port security is a safeguard in computer networks that allows only approved devices to connect to a network switch by checking their unique Mac address it's a basic Network defense at layer 2 preventing unauthorized access and attacks like mac flooding in such attacks hackers overload the switch with fake Mac addresses causing confusion and misdirected Network traffic Port security keeps the network secure by ensuring only recognized devices can connect in this first of a two-part episode of Cisco tech talk I'll explain the port security modes on Cisco Catalyst 1200 and 1300 series switches [Music] next there are four modes of Port Security on these switches classical lock limited Dynamic lock secure permanent and secure delete on reset I'll go through each of them so you can see the behavior with each Port mode setting and explain why you might choose that specific mode in classical lock mode all learned Mac addresses on a port are locked meaning the port will not learn any new Mac addresses any addresses that had been learned already are not subject to aging or relearning classical lock is ideal for situations where a switch Port is dedicated to a single device or a set number of devices this might be a server or a workstation that does not change frequently it ensures that no unauthorized devices can connect to the port as the Mac addresses are locked down this is designed to provide a high level of security to demonstrate how this works I'll access the web UI of a catalyst 1300 switch that is running on my network and go into advanced mode looking at the dynamic address table for Port three there were three Mac addresses already learned I'll head to Port security settings select Port G3 and enable classical lock I'll leave the action on violation set to discard which is the default and enable trap for CIS log messages after applying these settings a CIS log notification lets me know that the port has been locked now when I re visit the MAC address table you can see that the static addresses are populated with the Mac addresses from Port 3 adding a new Mac address to this port will result in a violation message as the new address will be discarded due to the violation of classical lock it's important to note that if no Mac addresses have been learned on a port by the time classical lock is enabled the port will not learn any new addresses to illustrate rate this I'll lock Port 5 with classical lock after applying the new settings the MAC address table shows no learned addresses on Port 5 any attempt to add a new Mac address will fail it will be discarded and the corresponding message will show another key point is that when a secure Mac address is seen on a different port the frame is forwarded but the MAC address is not learned on that new port for instance if I disconnect a client from Port 3 and connect it to another Port the port becomes active but no Mac address is learned on the New Port Mac address will only be expected on Port ge3 no entry will appear in the dynamic address table for Port ge1 furthermore static address entries will remain in the table even after a reboot of the switch provided you save the running configuration I'll demonstrate this by saving this configuration and disconnecting everything from Port 3 after rebooting the switch you can see the entries are still there the second Port security mode is limited Dynamic lock in this mode the device learns Mac addresses up to a configured limit of allowed addresses once the limit is reached no additional addresses are learned and the addresses are subject to aging and relearning this may be a a good option in environments where there is a need to limit the number of devices that can connect to a port but you need some flexibility for device changes this mode might work best in a conference room or a classroom where different users May connect their devices at different times but the total number of simultaneous connections should be controlled to demonstrate limited Dynamic lock I'll go to the port security settings for Port 7 select limited dynamic lock set the maximum number of allowed addresses to three and apply the settings then I'll lock the port select discard on violation enable trap for messages and click apply by navigating to the dynamic addresses option under the MAC address tables menu you can then observe that after adding three Mac addresses the limit is reached and any additional addresses are discarded these are dynamic entries on Port 7 so upon removing the connected device on Port 7 these three entries will get deleted that's a wrap on part one click the link in the description for part two where I'll explain and demonstrate the last two Port security mode options thanks for watching I'll see you soon [Music]",

    "transcript": "welcome back in this second of a two-part episode of Cisco tech talk I'll show you how to configure static routes on a router and a layer 3 switch next for this demonstration I've set up a specific Network topology it includes layer 3 switches which means they are routing capable the switches are connected over VLAN 100 using access ports this configuration allows vlans with identical names to exist on both switches without causing any conflicts for instance both switches can have a VLAN one assigned to different subnets and since there is no trunk link between the switches there's no conflict to demonstrate static routing I have connected my PC labeled PC3 to an access port that is a member of VLAN 15 on layer 3 switch I've assigned a static IP address to my PC which resides within the subnet of VLAN 15 from PC3 I can easily access PC2 which is in VLAN 25 I can verify connectivity by sending icmp requests to a device in vlan25 and receiving responses however pinging pc1 in VLAN 20 presents a different situation PC 1 is connected to switch a and there is no direct layer 2 or layer 3 communication path to it attempting to Ping pc1 will show no connectivity to establish this connectivity we need to create static routes first I'll connect to switch B to create a static route I will show that both switches are interconnected through VLAN 100 over access ports which are Port one on each switch in the ipv4 configuration I will set a static route indicating that to access network 10.20 20.0 sl24 packets must be directed to the next hop which is the IP address of layer 3 switch a after applying the static route it's crucial to note that although switch B can now direct packets correctly switch a still won't be able to Route the return icmp replies because it has no route to the network of PC3 to address this I'll connect to switch a via a console cable and create the necessary static route using the command line interface CLI after entering the global configuration mode on switch a I'll use the command IP route to create a static route if I want to reach Network 10.15.1 15.24 I must direct the packets to switch B which has the IP address 10.1 100.1 100.2 to confirm that the static route has been added I'll type show IP route and observe that the static route is present in the routing table now consider accessing the internet here the default route becomes critical as it usually provides access to the public network or the internet to illustrate this I'll change the configuration slightly by adding a connection through VLAN 1 to a router which will provide internet access and the default route the default route is usually indicated by 0.0.0.0 sl0 in the routing table this route can be obtained either statically through manual configuration or dynamically from a DHCP server connecting the switch to the router will result in the switch receiving an IP address for VLAN 1 from the DHCP server refreshing the static routes will display the default route provided by the DHCP server it's important to note that by default the router will only provide internet access to clients in VLAN 1 to extend internet access to other networks such as VLAN 15 an additional static route must be added to the router to ensure return internet packets can find their way back to the correct network if you log into the router and navigate to the static routing section you can see the static route that has been been created for Network VLAN 15 without this static route the router would not know how to route return packets from the internet to manually create a default route on switch a the following configuration command would be used IP route 0.0.0.0 to match any destination Network address then 0.0.0.0 to match any subnet mask the last IP address is the the next hop address that the packet should be sent to on its way to the Final Destination usually a router that's all there is to it now you can configure static routes using the web user interface or via CLI thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

    "transcript": "Your business relies on smooth network operations. So, losing access to your switch because of a forgotten password can cause a bit of panic, especially if you're new to managing network devices. Knowing how to recover a password can save you from unnecessary downtime and potential security risks. In this episode of Cisco Tech Talk, I'll show you how to perform password recovery for Catalyst 1200 and 1300 series switches. Next, [Music] for this example, I'll use a Windows PC. First, open the device manager on the PC and select ports. Once the computer is connected to the console port on the switch, identify which COM port is being used. In this example, it is COM 3. Next, open Putty and choose the connection type as serial. Ensure the serial line is COM 3 and set the speed to 115200. At the bottom, select serial. Leave the initial settings as default and set flow control to none. After the settings are configured, return to the session menu and click open. To proceed, restart the switch by unplugging the power source. Once you plug the power source back, the switch will begin booting. After a moment, a 2- second message will appear. Press enter to abort the process. You will now see the startup menu. Choose option three for the password recovery procedure and press enter. Then press escape to exit the boot menu and allow the switch to bypass the password and username requirement. After a few seconds, the switch will finish booting and you will have access to it. Enter the command enable and type config t. You can then change the password by typing the command username followed by the desired username. You can use the existing username or create a new one. Then enter the word password followed by the new password and set the privilege level to 15. The privilege level must be set to 15 to grant the user full access to the device. If not, a password will be required to access enable mode. The next time you log in, exit the global configuration mode. Save the changes with the command write and then select yes to confirm. Reboot the device by entering the command reload and confirm by typing Y for yes. Now you can access the switch with the username and password you created. It's important to note that if the no service password recovery has been configured, you can still access the boot menu and initiate the password recovery process. However, in this scenario, all configuration files and user files will be removed. That's it. Just a few simple steps for password recovery on your Catalyst 1200 or 1300 series switch. For more details on service password recovery, click the link in the description. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time. [Music]",

    "transcript": "When you're setting up an office or a home security system, you probably have devices like IP phones, wireless access points, and security cameras. You're excited about getting everything up and running. But then you realize each device needs both a network connection and a power source. The thought of dealing with all those cables and finding enough electrical outlets can be overwhelming, right? Well, this is where power over Ethernet, PoE, comes to the rescue. It's a nifty technology that can make your setup process a lot simpler and more efficient. In this episode of Cisco Tech Talk, I'll explain the basics of PoE. Next, [Music] so what exactly is power over Ethernet? Simply put, PoE allows you to deliver both power and data to devices using a single Ethernet cable. Normally, Ethernet cables are just for data, while power cables supply electricity. PoE combines these two functions, eliminating the need for separate power cords. This makes everything much easier to manage, especially in places where running lots of cables would be a hassle. Cisco offers several business class switches with PoE ports, including models in the business 110, 220, 250, and 350 series and the Catalyst 1200 and 1300 series. If a Cisco business class switch has PoE support, it will be signified with a P in the model number. Depending on the model, some or all of these ports may have PoE. They're typically designated by color or with a lightning bolt. One of the biggest advantages of PoE is its ease of use. Setting up devices becomes a lot more straightforward because you only have to deal with one type of cable. You can position devices like IP phones, wireless access points, and security cameras wherever you need without worrying about how to power them. This flexibility is invaluable in both professional and home settings. Imagine being able to place a security camera in the perfect spot for coverage, even if there isn't an electrical outlet nearby. With PoE, that's entirely possible. PoE isn't just about convenience. It's also about centralized power management. You can control the power to all your PoE devices from one central location. This means you can easily reboot devices, turn them on or off, or adjust their power consumption without having to physically go to each device. This centralized control can lead to significant energy savings over time, as you can power down devices when they're not needed. Safety is another key benefit of PoE. Traditional electrical wiring can pose risks like overloads or underpowering, which can damage equipment. PoE systems are designed to intelligently manage power delivery, ensuring that each device gets the right amount of power without the risk of overload or damage. This built-in safety feature provides peace of mind knowing that your equipment is protected. The installation process is simplified with PoE. Since you don't need a qualified electrician to lay down network cables, it's easier and more cost-effective to set up your network. This can be particularly beneficial in larger installations such as office buildings or campuses where the cost and complexity of electrical wiring can be significant. Additionally, PoE offers enhanced control and monitoring. Features like perport power consumption control and Cisco PoE MIB's management information bases let you monitor and manage power usage proactively. This means you can see how much power each device is using and adjust as needed, further optimizing your energy use and saving on costs. So, next time you find yourself tangled in a mess of cables, remember that PoE might just be the streamlined solution you need. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time. [Music]",

    "transcript": "The domain name system DNS is like the internet's phone book. When an easily remembered website like cisco.com is entered into a browser, it looks up its corresponding unique IP address and changes the search to that address. This is necessary for devices to communicate with other devices on the internet. Most businesses use the default DNS servers that come with their internet service provider ISP for this. However, there are public DNS servers you can use instead, which can provide some good benefits. In this first of a two-part episode of Cisco Tech Talk, I'll explain some benefits of using a public DNS server and show you how to change it on some individual devices. Next, [Music] Public DNS servers are managed by thirdparty companies and are open for anyone to use. They can be a good alternative. Public DNS servers often load websites faster, have better uptime and fewer outages, and may even provide additional security and privacy. Some of the most popular are Google DNS, Open DNS and Cloudflare. They provide both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. You can change the DNS server on different devices. Where you change the DNS settings depends on how widely you want the changes to apply and how much control you need. I will demonstrate the process on a few different devices. To keep it simple, I will use Google DNS for all of them. You can set a Windows computer to use a public DNS server with a few simple steps. Open the control panel on your computer. Select network and internet and then network connections. Doubleclick on your connection. Click properties. I'll select the IPv4 option. Enter the DNS server addresses you prefer. I'll enter 8.8. 8.8.8 as the preferred DNS server and 8.8.4.4 as the alternate. This setting applies to this one computer. You can also change your cell phone to use a public DNS server. To set this up on an iPhone iOS version 17, open settings, select the wireless network, and click the I next to the network name. Scroll down and select configure DNS. Choose manual. Delete the existing DNS server address and enter the public DNS server addresses. Click save in the top right corner of the screen. To change the DNS settings on an Android version 14, start by scrolling down the menu and selecting Wi-Fi. Choose the SSID that you're connected to. Click on settings, then view more options. If you are using DHCP, like in this example, you can't change the DNS settings. Switch this over to static. Keep this same IP address as before and ensure the gateway remains unchanged. For DNS, I'll switch to the public DNS server and then click save to apply the changes. Depending on your device and software version, these new settings may not transfer when you connect to a new wireless network. If they don't, you'll need to repeat the steps to apply when using this new network. That's all there is to it. With just a few steps, you can enjoy the benefits of using a public DNS server for your device. For a bigger impact, you can set your router so all devices using that router will use the public DNS server. I'll cover that in part two. The link is in the description. Thanks for watching. I'll see you soon. [Music]",

    "transcript": "Welcome back. In part one, I explained the benefits of using a public DNS server and how to change it on an individual device. By changing the DNS at the router level, you ensure that every device on your network benefits from the potentially faster, more reliable, and secure public DNS servers. In this episode of Cisco Tech Talk, I'll show you how to change DNS servers on an RV 160 wireless ACVPN router. Next, [Music] to change your RV 160 router to use a public DNS, start by accessing the router's web interface. If you know your router's IP address, open a browser and type it in. If you're unsure of the IP address, you can find it by going to the command prompt on your computer. Type ipconfig/all on Windows or if config on Mac or Linux. You can often look for the default gateway under your Ethernet adapter. Common IP addresses for routers are 192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1 0.1 or 10.0.0.1. However, it is important to note that in some scenarios, the default gateway on the PC will point to another device. If you use a router from your service provider, the IP address may be printed on the router itself or the manual that came with it. Once you have the IP address, enter it into your browser's address bar. You'll be prompted to log in with your username and password. After logging in, look for the DNS settings on the interface which are located on the main page for this model. This is for the WAN interface. The DNS server option will be available under the WAN settings page. Currently, you're most likely using the DNS provided by your internet service provider. To change it, select the use DNS as below checkbox and enter the new address. For Google's public DNS server, that's 8.8.8.8. For a secondary DNS, enter 8.8.4.4. Click the apply button to save the changes to the running configuration file. To save the changes on the startup configuration file, click the red save icon at the top of the page. Restart the router to verify that the changes took effect. Under the administration menu, the reboot option will be available. Click reboot. Select reboot the device. Click reboot and confirm by clicking okay. The router will restart, so you'll need to wait a few moments. Once the router is back online, log in again to confirm that the DNS changes have been applied successfully. Now your router should be using the new public DNS server settings. There you have it. Now devices such as computers, smartphones, smart devices, and printers connected to the network will automatically use the new DNS settings. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time. [Music]",

    "transcript": "Ever been in a crowded room and tried to have a private conversation? With so many people talking at the same time, it can be hard to hear. For a clear connection, spreading out into a less congested area makes sense. In this same way, wireless channels help devices communicate without interference. You could think of these channels as distinct lanes on a highway. By choosing the right lane or channel, data can travel smoothly. This is crucial for ensuring reliable connectivity, reducing interference, and improving speed, especially in environments with many devices. Setting up and fine-tuning wireless channels enhances your network's efficiency and strength, ensuring smooth communication for all connected devices. In this first of a two-part episode of Cisco Tech Talk, I'll explain Cisco Business Wireless CBW access point channels. Next, [Music] when setting up your wireless network, there is no one magic channel to choose for optimal performance. There are just too many factors that come into play. In a business environment, interference can come from neighboring Wi-Fi networks, electronic devices, or even physical obstacles like walls. Such interference can slow down your network, leading to frustrating delays or dropped connections. To combat this, it's essential to select the right wireless channels. CBW access points offer channels in two main frequency bands, 2.4 4 and 5 GHz. On the 2.4 GHz band, you can select channels from 1 to 11. While there are additional channels available, their availability depends on the region. In some parts of the world, channels up to 14 are offered, but only channels 1, 6, and 11 are considered non-over overlapping in most regions. This makes them ideal choices to reduce interference. To explain this further, the following visual shows that the channels in the 2.4 GHz band are spaced 5 MHz apart. Channel 1 has a frequency range from 2401 MHz to 2423 MHz. So, channel 5 with its starting frequency of 2421 MHz overlaps with channel 1. But channel 6 starts at 2426 MHz which doesn't overlap with channel 1. Similarly, channel 11 starts at 2451 MHz. It doesn't overlap with channel 6. The 2.4 GHz channels cover a larger area and can give access to devices that are further from the access point. They can penetrate walls and other obstacles more effectively. Some older devices need 2.4 GHz for compatibility. If the primary use of your network is for low bandwidth applications like web browsing, email or simple internet devices, this channel may be preferred since range can be more important than speed. The downside of the 2.4 4 GHz band is that it is more susceptible to interference because it is used by a lot of other devices such as microwaves and Bluetooth devices. Now, the 5 GHz band offers several advantages as well. One of the primary benefits is reduced congestion since it provides more available channels. This reduces the likelihood of interference from neighboring networks, enhancing the stability and speed of your connection. Speaking of speed, the 5 GHz band supports higher data rates, making it ideal for high bandwidth needs like video conferencing, cloud computing, and large file transfers. Many modern routers operating on the 5 GHz band also support advanced technologies like mumimo which stands for multi-user multiple input multiple output. It allows simultaneous efficient data transmission to multiple devices. The shorter range compared to the 2.4 4 GHz band and the fact that it may not penetrate walls and obstacles as effectively makes it a good option if your router and devices are relatively close to each other and you need a stable and fast connection within this range. That's a quick overview of the advantages and limitations of the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands. Click the link in the description for part two where I'll explain wireless channel configuration options on your CBWAP. Thanks for watching. I'll see you soon. [Music]",

    "transcript": "The simple network management protocol SNMP is a protocol used for managing and monitoring devices on a network which is especially handy in local networks. It helps with efficient operation of various devices through switches. SNMP v2c and SNMP v3 are the most commonly used versions today. At its core, SNMP V2C is known for its simplicity and ease of use, making it a popular choice for those who prefer straightforward setups. However, if security is a high priority, SNMP V3 may be a better fit. Understanding these differences can help you select the right version for your needs. If you are new to SNMP or unsure about which version to choose, you can learn more by clicking the link in the description. In this first of a two-part episode of Cisco Tech Talk, I'll show you how to configure SNMP V2C on a Catalyst 1200 or 1300 switch. Next, [Music] log into the graphical user interface guey of your switch. In this demonstration, I'll be using a Catalyst 1200 switch running firmware version 4.1.4.1. I am currently in basic view, which is fine for now. Navigate to the status and statistics section, then system summary. Here you'll find the system information section. It contains the data to collect using SNMP. The information includes system description, location, contact, host name, object ID, and uptime. Configure the system location, system contact and host name parameters so that these changes reflect in the system management information base MIB results after configuration and SNMP testing. Next, access the administration section and select system settings. Here you can configure the system location, system contact and host name values. Either use the default values or enter custom ones. I will configure these parameters to demonstrate how they work and click apply. Return to status and statistics then system summary to confirm that the information has been updated with the newly configured values. To activate SNMP, go to security and then TCP UDP services. Select the SNMP service option. The enable check box is unchecked. So click it and hit apply to activate the SNMP protocol. Under service name, you will see SNMP listed. Port 161 will be open in the UDP service table below. To configure SNMP version 2, switch to the advanced view in the GUI. At the end of the menu, the SNMP option will show providing configuration options. I will use views, groups, and communities. Starting with views, you will see the Catalyst 1200 has default SNMP views named default and default super. I'll create a new view to demonstrate how to allow all SNMP MIBs and then block a couple of object identifiers, oids. The target MIB will be system. I'll exclude two of its oids. Click the plus icon to create a view. Enter a name for the view to identify it and its purpose. Select userdefined and enter the number one which represents ISO in SNMP allowing all SNMP MIBs. Ensure the include in view check box is checked to allow all MIBs. Click apply when ready. Next, I'll exclude the two oids from the system MIB so they don't appear in the SNMP polling. Enter the view name again. Select userdefined and type the oid value to exclude. Uncheck the include in view box to exclude the oids. Click apply and repeat for the remaining oids. Close the window and the switch will show the configuration details. You can filter SNMP views to display data for the newly created view. That brings me to the end of part one. Click the link in the description for part two where I'll wrap up configurations and conduct some verification tests using SNMP version 2C. Thanks for watching. I'll see you soon. [Music]",

    "transcript": "Welcome back. In this second of a two-part episode of Cisco Tech Talk, I'll complete configuration of SNMP V2C on a Catalyst 1200 or 1300 switch. Next, still on the graphical user interface of the switch in advanced mode, configure the communities option to create three strings showcasing different options. Click the plus icon to configure parameters for the SNMP management station. Choose userdefined allowing configuration of who collects data from the switch via SNMP. Use your laptop's IP address for the IP address parameter. Enter a community string value. Set access mode to read only and select the newly created view. Click apply to create the first community string. The community table will summarize the configuration. Next, create another community string with read write permission and the default super view. Observe the switch's behavior. A community string with read write access mode becomes SNMP admin by default. Now create an SNMP version 2 group. In the groups option, click the plus icon in the group table. Name the SNMP group and set the security model to SNMP version 2 as you are using community strings. This automatically sets the security level to no authentication and no privacy allowing configuration of the read and write view. The notify option is unnecessary here. Click apply and close the window once configured. Return to the communities option. Complete the required parameters and create your community string. Set access mode to read write and select advanced to show the group name created earlier. Click apply again. Selecting read write access mode changes it to SNMP admin. Great. Everything is set. For verification, I will do some SNMP polling tests using Pacer SNMP tester, a third party application. It's important to note that this application is not supported by Cisco. It is being used for demonstration purposes only. I have it preconfigured with parameters such as my laptop's local IP address and the switch's IP address for SNMP version 2. In the community field, I'll enter the strings configured on the switch. Start with the first string, the readonly one, and use the custom view to query the device uptime. Verify that the CIS uptime instance value in SNMP matches the system uptime value on the GUI confirming SNMP is operational. Next, change the option to walk. Enter the OID for the system and run the query. Check it out. When you review the results, you see that system description, location, contact, host name, object ID, and uptime match between the tool and the switch guey. This confirms that SNMP version 2C is functioning. Now query the switch with the second community string, the read write one, which has SNMP admin access mode and uses the default super view. Observe that the system output is larger compared to using a limited view community string. This illustrates the difference between views. With the second string, more data is visible than with the first string, confirming the SNMP view configuration is correct. Lastly, query the switch with the third community string linked to an SNMP group using the limited view created earlier. The result will match the first string due to the SNMP view configuration. There you have it. SNMP version 2 is configured and properly running on your Catalyst 1200 or 1300 switch. If you ever decide that you need the security of version 3 instead, click the link in the description for configuration details. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time.",

    "transcript": "Welcome back. In part one, I gave an overview of the channel bands available on Cisco Business Wireless CBW access points and how proper selection can minimize interference and maximize performance. In this second of a two-part episode of Cisco Tech Talk, I'll explain some configuration options on your CBW access point. Next, Today I'll be configuring these settings on a CBW 150 access point. Log in and navigate to the access point menu. In this example, you can see the primary AP is operating on channel 1 while the mesh extender operates on channel 11. Clicking on an access point will show the channels selected for both the 2.4 4 GHz and 5 GHz radios. Troubleshooting options are available to identify nearby access points that could interfere with your device. The RF troubleshoot tool displays neighboring and rogue access points, helping you find sources of interference that might degrade performance. By hovering over an access point, you can view its channels and signal strength. The tool also offers insights into non-ifi interference sources under the clean air interfer section. Under the advanced menu, select RF optimization. If you aren't in expert view, click the birectional arrows in the top right corner and click okay to confirm. Now you can scroll down and see several options including interfer detection which is disabled by default. I have enabled it. This feature helps identify nearby interference sources. To check for interfer, navigate to the monitoring tab and click on interfer to see any nearby sources. Although nothing shows in this example, you can verify the details for rogue access points by clicking on them. To change the channel settings on an access point, go to the wireless settings, select the access point, and click edit. You'll see two radios, one for the 2.4 GHz band and one for the 5 GHz band. Channels can be set to automatic or manually selected from available options. Manually selecting channels can be complex if you aren't familiar with them. Automatic channel selection allows your access point to choose the best channel by scanning the environment to find the least congested one. This improves performance, ensuring your network runs smoothly. It also offers adaptability as the access point can adjust the channel to maintain optimal performance as the environment changes, such as when new networks appear. Consider using automatic channel selection if you are unsure about which ones to choose. It simplifies the setup process and optimizes performance. A few things to note. In the 5 GHz band, some channels are marked as DFS, dynamic frequency selection, which means they automatically adjust to avoid interference. If you are not using mesh extenders in your network, this can be disabled. Automatic channel assignments are supported in non- mesh deployments. Once you've made your selection, click apply to save the changes. Repeat for all access points. Be sure to click the save icon to save all new configurations. Now that you understand the types of interference you might encounter and how to choose appropriate settings, you can create a network that supports productivity and seamless communication through your CBW access point. If you'd like more information on wireless radio frequencies, check out Cisco's reference guide. The link is in the description. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time.",
